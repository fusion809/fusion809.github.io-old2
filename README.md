# The Hornery
This repository contains the Jekyll-powered GitHub Pages-hosted website, [*The Hornery*](https://fusion809.github.io), that is maintained by fusion809. This repo can also be used for demonstration purposes on how to create a Jekyll site. When I started this site my knowledge of CSS (and SCSS), HTML, JS, YML data files and using Jekyll or any static site generator was minimal/non-existent, and it is still no better than minimal, so my ability to set up this site and maintain it with so little knowledge is a testament to how easy Jekyll makes website creation.

This website is predominantly on Linux-related topics and includes howtos and comparisons of free and open-source software.

If you want to learn more about my FOSS contributions see the [*Projects*](https://fusion809.github.io/projects/) page on *The Hornery*.

## Running Jekyll Locally
A little how-to on how to run Jekyll on Linux and how to set up a GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll site that was once housed in this README can be found in the [*The Hornery*](http://fusion809.github.io/how-to-create-your-own-jekyll-site-with-github-pages/). As said in this post I personally use the Atom text editor to write most of *The Hornery*'s posts, if you want to install Atom on Linux I recommend you see the [`atom-installer`](https://github.com/fusion809/atom-installer) GitHub repository of mine.
