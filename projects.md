While I would not consider myself a programmer *per se*, I do develop and maintain packages for the Linux distributions I am particularly fond of. These distributions include:
* Arch Linux / Manjaro Linux &mdash; you can find these packages [here at the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=fusion809) and [here at the fusion809/PKGBUILDs repository](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs).
* Gentoo Linux / Sabayon Linux &mdash; you can find these packages [here at my overlay, `sabayon-tools`](https://github.com/fusion809/sabayon-tools).
* openSUSE Leap 42.1 / Tumbleweed &mdash; you can find these packages [here at my Open Build Service project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:fusion809/).
