While I would not consider myself a programmer *per se*, I do develop and maintain packages for the Linux distributions I am particularly fond of. These distributions include:

* **Arch Linux** / **Manjaro Linux** &mdash; you can find these packages [here at the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=fusion809) and [here at the fusion809/PKGBUILDs repository](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs).
* **Gentoo Linux** / **Sabayon Linux** &mdash; you can find these packages [here in my overlay, `sabayon-tools`](https://github.com/fusion809/sabayon-tools).
* **openSUSE Leap 42.1** / **Tumbleweed** &mdash; you can find these packages [here at my Open Build Service project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:fusion809/).

I also maintain several GitHub repositories of shell scripts which I use on a variety of different Linux distributions to automate package management and other tasks. They are:

* [`arch-scripts`](https://github.com/fusion809/arch-scripts) &mdash; scripts for Arch-based distributions.
* [`centos-scripts`](https://github.com/fusion809/centos-scripts) &mdash; scripts for CentOS-based distributions.
