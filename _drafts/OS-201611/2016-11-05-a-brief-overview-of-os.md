I have always been a curious critter, especially when it comes to operating systems, consequently I have tried over thirty different free operating systems. Most of these operating systems are Linux distributions, with BSD derivatives being the second largest subset. Linux distributions (LDs) can be further classed according to the following characteristics:

* Where on the stable/bleeding-edge spectrum its software falls. Most popular LDs fall on the stable side of this spectrum.
* Its developers' policies on the licensing of the software included in its official repositories.
* Its orientation. Essentially who is this distribution designed for? Is it designed for a Linux beginner or for advanced users or for those in between?
* The characteristics of its package manager.
* Its release model. Fixed release model vs. rolling release model.
* Whether it is minimalist or out-of-the-box or somewhere in between.

I should clarify that by a "free operating system" I mean an operating system (OS) that fulfils the following requirements:

* Is free (of charge) to download and install.
* Its default repositories contain only open-source software and, optionally, freeware software (such as proprietary binary blobs on its kernel).
* Its base components (such as its kernel, core utlities, *etc.*) are at least mostly open-source. I would like to say "entirely open-source" but most Linux distributions use the standard Linux kernel (complete with proprietary binary blobs).
