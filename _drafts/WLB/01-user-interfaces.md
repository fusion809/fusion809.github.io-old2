## User Interfaces
Before I proceed I should probably perform a brief compare and contrast between the more popular user interfaces (or desktop environments) for Linux. The most popular Linux user interfaces include: Cinnamon, Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE), Enlightenment, GNOME, KDE Plasma, LXDE, LXQt, MATE, Moksha, Pantheon, Trinity, Xfce and Unity. 

Cinnamon, DDE, GNOME, KDE Plasma and Unity are the heaviest user interfaces, in terms of their CPU and RAM usage. LXDE, LXQt, MATE, Moksha and Xfce are the lighter desktop environments, with LXDE likely the lightest of all, in terms of CPU/RAM usage. Enlightenment, Pantheon and Trinity are probably middle of the road in terms of resource usage. 

KDE Plasma is probably the most configurable (or customizable) of all user interfaces, followed closely by Cinnamon, Trinity and Xfce. GNOME is also rather customizable, although, in my opinion, it seems to focus more on the, "less is more" design philosophy, trying not to overwhelm users with customization options. Enlightenment, LXDE, MATE, Moksha and Pantheon are moderately customizable, similarly to GNOME. DDE, LXQt and Unity are fairly minimally customizable, I would argue LXQt is the least customizable.

DDE, Enlightenment, GNOME, KDE Plasma, LXDE, Pantheon and Xfce are all &ldquo;original&rdquo; user interfaces, not forked from any others.
