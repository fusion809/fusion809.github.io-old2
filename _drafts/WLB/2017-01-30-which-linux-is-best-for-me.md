A common question Linux newcomers face is, "Which of these hundreds of different Linux distributions should I use?" For me I choose Ubuntu as my first Linux distribution. It did not take me long to decide on Ubuntu, as I did not put much thought into the decision. Many other first-time Linux users do, in fact, put more thought into this decision, and rightly so. Out-of-the-box is an important concept for readers to understand. A feature that comes with a distribution "out-of-the-box" is one that the distribution comes with, by default and often it is included in the live installation media of the distribution. This is as opposed to a feature one has to set up for oneself. I would also recommend reading through the [glossary](/glossary/) of *The Hornery*, if any of the terms I use are confusing, although I will do my best to explain them here.
