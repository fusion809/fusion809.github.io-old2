## Recipe
**Recipes** are shell scripts that automate the process of building an AppImage. That is, they create a suitable AppDir for building an AppImage and then builds it using `appimagetool`. They were once the recommended way of building AppImages in an easily reproducible way, but this has since changed since the introduction of the yaml Recipe.
