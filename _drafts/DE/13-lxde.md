### Background
**LXDE** is a popular lightweight desktop environment that is based on GTK+ 2. Its development began in 2006 and was originally and is presently lead by Hong Jen Yee, whom is also known as PCMan. LXDE is reported to not only be lightweight but to also save electricity and extend the life of one's computer hardware. Despite these advantages I personally find it a very dull and boring desktop environment and I usually cannot tolerate it for anymore than a few hours at a time. Most configuration of LXDE and its associated window manager (that can be used standalone), Openbox, is
best done textually via editing configuration files.

The vast majority of Linux distributions have LXDE in their software repositories.  

### Components
* **Display server/window manager**: X11.
* **File manager**: PCManFM.
* **Widget toolkit**: GTK+ 2.
* **Window manager**: Openbox.

LXDE has its own core application suite, which is not as comprehensive as GNOME's or KDE's. The most notable component, in my opinion, is LXTerminal, a terminal emulator.

### Obtaining It
LXDE is easily obtaining on most Linux distributions via their package managers.
