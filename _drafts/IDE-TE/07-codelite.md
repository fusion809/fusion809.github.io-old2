## CodeLite

### Background
[**CodeLite**](http://codelite.org/) is a lightweight IDE for C, C++, PHP and Node.js that is written in C and C++. It does not support any other programming languages, besides these four. I personally have found it a nuisance to use, as its interface does not include a button to click in order to compile and/or run your C/C++ program. Plus I have found it a challenge to figure out how to build a program in it anyway.

### Customizability
I have limited experience with CodeLite, so I cannot really comment with confidence on its customizability, but from what I understand it is designed to be lightweight and their website does not really mention any plugins or other customizations.

### Features
It is fairly feature-packed (including git, subversion, GUI-building, *etc.* support) for the programming languages it supports.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Cross-platform able to run on Windows, OS X and Linux.
* Fairly lightweight for an IDE.
* Feature-packed.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Support for only four programming languages.
* Not in the official binary package repositories for either Manjaro or Sabayon.
