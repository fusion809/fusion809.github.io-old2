### Background
[**KDevelop**](https://www.kdevelop.org/) is an IDE that is part of the KDE Core Applications (KDE-CA) suite, unlike most other members of the KDE-CA suite it is still based on Qt4 and has not yet made the transition to KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5). Plans to transition to KF5 are currently in place for the near future. It is designed for C, C++, PHP and Python development.

### Customizability
KDevelop is a program I have little experience with, but if you go to the "Settings" menu you can choose to modify the program's keyboard shortcuts and other aspects of its behaviour.

### Features
KDevelop features source code editor support (including syntax highlighting, autocompletion, autoindentation, *etc.*) for its four programming languages, it also has in-built support for git and compilers/interpreters for C, C++, PHP and Python.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Easy to install.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Only supports four programming languages.
* Not very customizable.
