### Background
[**PyCharm Community Edition**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or **PyCharm CE**, is a free and open-source IDE for Python development that is written in Java and developed by JetBrains (the same company that develops IntelliJ IDEA). As it is written in Java it is cross-platform and able to run on Linux, OS X and Windows. Like IntelliJ IDEA it has a proprietary counterpart that is more feature-packed than its FOSS equivalent that this section is about.

### Customizability
It has a [plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/?pycharm), with plugins to extend its capabilities.

### Features
It is not as feature-packed as its proprietary counterpart, but it does have a pretty good feature set. This includes the basic text editor amenities such as syntax highlighting for Python, auto-indentation, *etc.* as well as an in-built interpreter for Python that can be set to use whichever interpreter one has installed on one's system.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Cross-platform.
* feature-packed.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Heavy on system resource usage.
