<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 7-8. Available from the official repositories of some distros, distributions who's official repositories it is not in usually have official binary releases for download from the Atom website.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: &geq;8. It is easy for beginners to use it, as it uses the same keymap as several basic text editors like gedit and Notepad.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 8. It is totally customizable, for those with the skill and time. For lay persons its customizability is more limited, to customization with available packages and themes.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8. Most computer languages are covered by Atom's syntax highlighting plugins, but some are not, for example, it does not yet have support for <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/syntax-highlighting-for-desktop-configuration-files/21764">desktop configuration files</a>.</li>
	<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: &geq;8. It is my default text editor.</li>
	<li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 2-3. On Sabayon, <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/atom,163154,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" link="_blank">Atom 1.3.2</a> is a 63.1 MB download, when it is installed it takes up a total space of 196.2 MB. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table for running Atom 1.3.2 under MATE: {% include Code/gist.html id="b8e4d2082e93f52a5467" %} on Manjaro Linux with version 1.3.2 of Atom I got this <code>ps_mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="49025ad8574ecd9bf72f" %} and Atom 1.3.3 is a 201.1 MB program when installed. As for its download size well it is difficult for me to ascertain as the source code tarball is a 7.9 MB download for version 1.3.3, but as this package is installed from the AUR this means that the source code must be compiled too, which in itself also requires some downloading to occur.</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8-9. It is my favourite text editor, but it is still early days, its System Resource Usage and boot time are issues that are being worked on, new packages and themes are created every week.</li>
