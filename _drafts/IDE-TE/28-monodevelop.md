### Background
[**MonoDevelop**](http://www.monodevelop.com/) (or **MD** for short) is a cross-platform IDE that is primarily intended to be used by Mono/.NET developers. It is itself written almost entirely in C#, and has autocomplete, linting and syntax-highlighting support for a wide variety of different Mono/.NET framework languages such as C, C++, C#, D, F# and Vala. It also has a visual designer for building Gtk# (GTK+ with C# findings) interfaces. It is developed by Xamarin (which itself is a subsidiary of Microsoft) and its own FOSS community. Despite being considered "cross-platform", capable of running on Linux, OS X and Windows NT, many of its features are limited to Linux (source: [*Feature List*](http://www.monodevelop.com/documentation/feature-list/)). For example, debugging C/C++ programs with MonoDevelop is limited to Linux platforms.
