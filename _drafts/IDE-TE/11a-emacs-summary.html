<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: &gt;8. Found in the official repositories of most distributions.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: &leq;5. Not particularly difficult for a newcomer to use as a basic text editor, but any further usage requires extensive knowledge of ELisp. Super-efficient use also requires one to learn its unconventional keyboard shortcuts.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;9. Extensively customizable for all those that understand ELisp sufficiently.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;9. It is one of the most feature-packed text editors available today.</li>
	<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 3. Used to use it when it was the default TE of GNU Octave. Like Vim, I have found it fustrating in its unconventional keybindings.</li>
	<li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 7-8. <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/emacs,158951,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">Emacs 24.5</a> is a 35.8 MB download and takes up 142.2 MB HDD space when installed. Fairly lightweight as far as text editors go, RAM-wise. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="ae46ee9afdfdd2d13c91" %} on Manjaro Linux, GNU Emacs 24.5 is a 36.3 MB download and takes up 99.4 MB when installed and gave this <code>ps_mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="2a25829b131e9c96d6b3" %}</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8. It is a very powerful text editor, but to me, its lack of customizability by those that do not understand ELisp is a significant disadvantage.</li>
