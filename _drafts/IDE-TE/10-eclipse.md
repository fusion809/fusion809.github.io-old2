[**Eclipse**](http://eclipse.org/eclipse) is a free and open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) written in Java, that is primarily used for programming in C, C++, Java and PHP, although it is possible to program in other languages (such as D, Lua, Perl and Python) using it too. These other languages usually require the installation of additional plugins as [PyDev](http://www.pydev.org/) for Python. It features in-built support for several compilers and interpreters and has autocomplete/linter integration.

### Customizability
I do not have enough experience with Eclipse to make any comment on its customizability, but I do know that extra functionality is usually added using plugins.

### Features
Eclipse features a text editor with syntax-highlighting, debugging, linting and auto-complete support for most programming languages, in-built support for several compilers and interpreters, it also supports the use of project views, *etc.*

### Advantages (Pros)
* Written in Java, so it is incredibly cross-platform. Any Java-capable platform should be able to run Eclipse without a problem.
* Easy to install, using the new installer.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Most distributions either do not have it in their official repositories or keep fairly old versions in their official repositories.
* Fairly heavy on system resource usage.
* Slow to boot.
* Extra plugins are required in order to program in other programming languages.
