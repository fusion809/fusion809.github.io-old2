### Background
[**Leafpad**](http://tarot.freeshell.org/leafpad/) is a lightweight and basic GTK+ based text editor. Its capabilities (or rather lack thereof) are very similar to those of Windows' Notepad.

### Customizability
There is little, if any, customizability for Leafpad.

### Features
It offers no syntax highlighting support or auto-indentation support that I am aware of.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Its chief advantage is its low system resource usage.
* Easy to install on most distributions.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* It is very basic, has minimal customizability or features.
