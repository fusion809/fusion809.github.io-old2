### Background
[**IntelliJ IDEA**](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), which I will abbreviate as **IJCE**, is a free and open-source IDE developed by JetBrains that is designed specifically for Java development. It is the free counterpart to a proprietary IDE (called IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition) that is more feature-packed with support for several additional programming languages. Its support for programming languages is extended by use of plugins &mdash; the ultimate edition can even get a Python plugin that will provide it with all the features of PyCharm Professional Edition, which is also developed by JetBrains.

### Customizability
IntelliJ IDEA's customizability is something I really cannot comment on, but I would imagine it is not very customizable due to the fact that this would defeat the purpose of JetBeans creating a community edition, which is to tempt users to buy the proprietary, Ultimate Edition, with the extra features it has as opposed to the community edition.

### Features
Its features is something I cannot really comment on as I have limited experience with it, but it does not support any programming languages beyond a limited set including and related to Java like the Groovy programming language.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Easy to install on any Linux platform.
* Cross-platform.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Cannot be installed via the usual methods on most distributions.
* Limited set of features and supported languages
