### Customizability
The `~/.geany` directory is where customizations are kept. This customization can be made with code [snippets](http://www.geany.org/Download/Extras) (written in HTML, LaTeX, PHP and Python), [plugins](http://www.geany.org/Support/Plugins), [themes](https://github.com/geany/geany-themes/), *etc*.

### Features
Geany provides auto-indentation and syntax-highlighting for over a dozen different computer languages. Geany has an embedded terminal emulator. Several extra features can be added to Geany, using plugins.

### Advantages (Pros)
* It has a few IDE-type features.
* It is fairly lightweight.
* It is cross-platform, hence if you switch from Sabayon to another OS fairly frequently, it should not be too difficult to get Geany on said OS.
* Keyboard shortcuts are fairly intuitive.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* The list of supported computer languages, for syntax-highlighting and other features is fairly small, compared to Atom, Gedit, GNU Emacs and Vim. See for example, the screenshot below, showing allowed file types.
