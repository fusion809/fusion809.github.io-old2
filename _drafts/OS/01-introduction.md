As soon as you enter the {% include Layouts/abbr.md abbr="FOSS" full="Free and Open-Source Software" %} world, you will likely want to start off by switching your **operating system** (OS) from a proprietary one to a more **free** and **open-source** one. I have written posts similar to this one before, but this one I plan on making more comprehensive. I will compare the various free operating systems I have sufficient experience with to review. It is worthwhile noting that many of these operating systems are not 100% free and open-source,[^1] rather they are predominantly free and open-source in terms of the software that comes installed on them, by default, and cost the end-user nothing to legally attain and use.
