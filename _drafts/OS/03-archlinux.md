## Arch Linux
[**Arch Linux**](https://www.archlinux.org/) is a Linux distribution that's development was started by Canadian programmer, Judd Vinet, in early 2001. Arch's first public release, however, was not until March 2002. Vinet wanted to develop a system with the minimalism and simplicity of FreeBSD, Slackware and other **barebones-type operating systems** available at the time, but with a simpler package management system (PMS) than these existing operating systems. This PMS was and is still called **pacman**, which is a binary package manager, written in C, that is quite easily the fastest package manager mentioned in this post. pacman is essentially what makes setting up an Arch system faster and its maintenance easier and less tedious than it is for the source-based barebones operating systems FreeBSD and Gentoo Linux. Arch Linux, like Gentoo Linux, follows a **rolling release model** and is more geared towards **advanced users**.

Arch Linux is available only for ARM, i686 and x86_64 architectures. It is said to be geared towards more advanced users because of the mere fact that installation is from the command-line and has to be done entirely manually. This process requires some advanced knowledge, on the user's part, especially with respect to how to partition a disk, set up a network connection, chroot into and set-up a system entirely from the command-line.
