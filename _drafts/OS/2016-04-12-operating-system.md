As soon as you enter the FOSS world, you will likely want to start off by switching your operating system (OS) from a proprietary one to a more free and open-source one. I have written posts similar to this one before, but this one I plan on making more comprehensive. I will compare the various free operating systems I have sufficient experience with to review. It is worthwhile noting that many of these operating systems are not 100% free and open-source (such operating systems are said to be *libre*), rather they are predominantly free and open-source in terms of the software that comes installed on them, by default, and cost the end-user nothing to legally attain and use.

## Ratings
{% include Layouts/notei.md note1="I will use the term &ldquo;1-5&rdquo; to refer to characteristics that will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A rating of 1 indicates that this property is absent or poor. 5 indicates that this feature is a strong point of this OS." note2="I will also provide acronyms for each question, to be used to save space in the &ldquo;Ratings&rdquo; subsection of each OS section. These acronyms will only be applicable in these Ratings subsections, elsewhere the **PMS** acronym may be used for package management system." %}
Each operating system will be rated with respect to the following characteristics:

* How beginner-friendly is this OS? (**BFO**) 1-5.
* How comprehensive, extensive, easy-to-find and easy-to-understand is the available documentation for this OS? (**CED**) 1-5.
* How easy is package development for this OS? (**EPD**) 1-5.
* How free and open-source is this system? (**FOS**) 1-5. 5 indicates that it satisfies the Free Software Foundation's definition of a **free operating system**. 4 indicates that its official repositories are entirely FOSS, but it may have binary blobs still attached to its kernel.
* How comprehensive are its official software repositories? (**OSR**) 1-5.
* How out-of-the-box is this system? (**OTB**) 1-5.
* How easy is package manager on this system? (**PMS**) 1-5.
* On which side of the spectrum of stability vs. bleeding edge software does this OS lie? (**SBE**) 1-5.
* How comprehensive and easy-to-find are unofficial software repositories? (**USR**) 1-5.

## Arch Linux
**Arch Linux** is a Linux distribution that's development was started by Canadian programmer, Judd Vinet, in early 2001. Arch's first public release, however, was in March 2002. Vinet wanted to develop a system with the simplicity of FreeBSD, Slackware and other barebones-type operating systems available at the time, but with a better, or more simple, package management system (PMS) than these existing systems. This PMS was called **pacman** and was written in C and is quite easily the fastest package manager mentioned in this post.
