## Footnotes
[^1]: Systems that are entirely free and open-source I will refer to as *libre* to distinguish them from those that are not.
[^2]: Which can be a little complicated for those of us with Broadcom Wi-Fi chips, due to the proprietary firmware these devices require not being in the official Arch Linux repositories.
[^3]: This is for the simplest scenario, in which you wish to install GRUB2 on the same disk as you have Arch installed. This disk should also have either a MBR or GPT partition table. Further details can be found in the [GRUB2 article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB) at *The ArchWiki*.
