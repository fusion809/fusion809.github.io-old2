***FreeCol*** is an open-source clone of [Sid Meier's Colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Colonization). Its graphics are similarly two-dimensional and low-quality. It is fairly similar to *Freeciv* in that one has to create a civilization (or colony) of settlers in the New World (the Americas) and defeat the royal expeditionary forces. The storyline of *FreeCol* begins in 1492. In theory, as it is written in Java, it should be runnable on any Java-compatible platform and it is known to run on FreeBSD, Linux, macOS and Windows NT.
