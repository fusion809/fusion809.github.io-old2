***FreedroidRPG*** is a free and open-source, cross-platform role-playing game (RPG) wherein one plays as Tux to save the world from merciless robots, in a world ravaged by a conflict between robots and humans. I found myself stuck in its tutorial so I have not played the game all that much. Its graphics are 3D and are of reasonable quality, not quite as high quality as *RuneScape*'s NXT client or *0 A.D.*
