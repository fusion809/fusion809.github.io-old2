***Bos Wars*** is a free and open-source, cross-platform, futuristic RTS game. Like most RTS games in *Bos Wars* one has to fight their enemy armies while developing their economy. *Bos Wars* is fairly infrequently updated with its last update being version 2.7 which was released in June 2013, almost four years ago. Its graphics are poor, although I doubt its developers ever intended its graphics to be anything worth showing-off. Both single-player (wherein one plays against the computer) and multiplayer (wherein one plays against other players) options for playing the game are available.
