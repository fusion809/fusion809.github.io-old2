## Criteria
What makes a great game really differs according to personal opinion. I personally prefer games that are (1) free-to-play, (2) open-source, (3) Linux-compatible, (4) lightweight, (5) have high-definition 3D graphics and (6) fit into one of three possible genres:

* Massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).
* Racing games.
* Real-time strategy.

Unfortunately, however, no game I am aware of fulfils all six of these requirements. The game closest to fulfilling these requirements is probably *0 A.D.* as the only one of these requirements it does not meet is (5). As a result of these limitations I am forced to settle for games that do not tick all the boxes, but nevertheless the Linux world has numerous games to offer.

The criteria for a game getting a mention in this post are that:

* The game is fairly noteworthy or popular. If the game is in the official repositories of at least two popular, independent Linux distributions it should qualify for this. 
* The game *at least* has a free-to-play version available. Despite this fairly loose requirement, most games covered in this post are free-to-play and open-source.
* The game is Linux-compatible. Most games that are Linux-compatible are also compatible with the most popular desktop/laptop operating systems macOS and Windows NT.
