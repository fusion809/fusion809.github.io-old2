## Criteria
What makes a great game really differs according to personal opinion. I personally prefer games that are free-to-play, open-source, Linux-compatible, lightweight, have high-definition 3D graphics and fit into one of three possible genres:

* Massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).
* Racing games.
* Real-time strategy.

Unfortunately, however, no game I am aware of fulfils each of these requirements. The game closest to fulfilling these requirements is probably *0 A.D.* as the only one of these requirements it does not meet is the lightweight one.
