***Alien Arena*** is a mixed-licensed, cross-platform first-person shooter (FPS) game that uses the [Open Dynamics Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Dynamics_Engine) (ODE) as its game physics engine. In *Alien Arena* one is an alien fighting other aliens. The game also features an in-built IRC client for communicating with other players. I personally have fairly limited experience with it, but on Gentoo Linux, at least, I have found it quite a pain to get the game to go full-screen (I have a laptop with 1600x900 optimal resolution, the closest resolution allowed by the game is 1600x1200) without parts of the screen being hidden from one's view, or bizarre mouse issues happening. Its graphics, while 3D, are not quite as high quality, in my opinion, as *0 A.D.*'s.

The latest release of *Alien Arena* was in September 2013.{% include_relative fn-inline.html no="7" %} Despite this, COR Entertainment still seems active in developing *Alien Arena*, as they have asked people to vote for their upcoming game, "[*Alien Arena: Warriors of Mars*](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=897799480)" on Steam Greenlight.{% include_relative fn-inline.html no="8" %}

On most Linux distributions the installed size of *Alien Arena* is around 1.15 GB, for example, here is a command I ran on Gentoo Linux (on 1 May 2017) and its output:
