**OpenRA** is a free, cross-platform (supporting Linux, macOS and Windows NT) RTS game that is an open-source remake of <i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i>. It strives for compatibility with the original <i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i> game, but it does have a few extra features not found in <i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i>. In it one leads a fairly modern society and must command units to make the money one needs to fund an army capable of defeating opposing team(s). In it one can play against other players or against any (or even multiple different bots) of four different bots (Naval AI, Normal AI, Petra AI and Turtle AI). There are three mods available for the game: Dune 2000, Red Alert (the default; its logo is also the official OpenRA logo) and Tiberian Dawn. For details about the back-story of each mod see the [OpenRA about page](http://www.openra.net/about/). Each mod has a series of maps on which one can play. 

OpenRA is unusual among games in that it is written in C# and is built on the Mono framework. Most games are written in C, C++ or occasionally Python. Its graphics are low-quality, although frankly I do not think graphics are really a priority for its development team as otherwise they probably would not write it in C#.
