***Eternal Lands*** (***EL***) is an open-source, free-to-play, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). It is written predominantly in C and uses OpenGL and SDL for graphics rendering. Its graphics are lower quality, in my opinion, than *RuneScape* (both the old deprecated Java client and the newer NXT client) and 0 A.D., and similar to that of SuperTuxKart.


### Availability
*Eternal Lands* is less ubiquitous in the Linux world than 0 A.D. or SuperTux, although a universal shell script installer exists for it on Linux and can be downloaded from the [*Eternal Lands* download page](http://www.eternal-lands.com/page/download.php). A package for *Eternal Lands* is available from the official repositories of the following Linux distributions:

* {% include Packages/gentoo.html no="1" package="games-rpg/eternal-lands" %}, although the official repositories only provide the slightly outdated 1.9.3 version of Eternal Lands (where 1.9.4 is available).
* {% include Packages/sabayon.html no="1" package="games-rpg/eternal-lands" %}, Sabayon's package is built from the outdated 1.9.3 ebuild in the Portage tree.

and it is not available for the following distributions, from their official repositories anyway:

* Arch Linux, although an up-to-date [`eternallands`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eternallands) AUR package exists.
* CentOS
* Debian
* Fedora
* Mageia
* openSUSE, although an up-to-date [`eternal-lands`](http://software.opensuse.org/package/eternal-lands) package exists in the unofficial `games` repository.
* Ubuntu
