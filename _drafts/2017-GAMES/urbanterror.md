***Urban Terror*** is a mixed-licensed, cross-platform FPS game. It uses its own open-source fork of the ioquake3 game engine, but all game content and code is proprietary-licensed. It is unusual among games I have tried in that instead of taking a username (with or without a password too) to play, it requires one to register on its website and then get an authentication key and enter it to login to the game. I personally have found its graphics high-quality, in similar quality to 0 A.D. and RuneScape. I have only limited experience with this game, but from what I can tell it seems rather high-quality. The only thing about it I dislike is its unusual keybindings. In most games one uses the arrow keys to move, but in *Urban Terror* one uses letter keys to move.

### Availability
It is available from the official repositories of:

* {% include Packages/archlinux.html no="1" repo="community" arch="x86_64" package="urbanterror" %}
* {% include Packages/gentoo.html no="1" package="games-fps/urbanterror" %}
* {% include Packages/mageia.html no="1" package="urbanterror" %}
* {% include Packages/sabayon.html no="1" package="games-fps/urbanterror" %}

While it is not available from the official repositories of:

* CentOS
* Debian
* Fedora
* openSUSE
* Ubuntu

this is not surprising as CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu have largely open-source only repositories, although in the case of Debian and Ubuntu proprietary device driver packages do exist in their official repositories.
