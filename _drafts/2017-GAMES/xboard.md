***XBoard*** is a free and open-source, X11 graphical front-end to any of a variety of different chess game engines like *Crafty* or *GNU Chess*. It is developed as part of the GNU Project, unlike *GNOME Chess* *Xboard* seems to only support singleplayer mode, that is, when the player plays against the computer (namely the game engine).
