***XBoard*** is a free and open-source, X11 graphical front-end to any of a variety of different chess game engines like *Crafty* or *GNU Chess*. It is developed as part of the GNU Project, unlike *GNOME Chess* *XBoard* seems to only support single-player mode, that is, when the player plays against the computer (namely the game engine). In my opinion its interface is still stuck in the 1990s and is less intuitive than that of *GNOME Chess*, although unlike *GNOME Chess* it has been ported to a wide array of different operating systems. One can undo moves in XBoard, it is just an option that took me a while to find as it is hidden in the "Engine" drop menu and is called "Retract Move", while usually this option is called "Undo" in other games.
