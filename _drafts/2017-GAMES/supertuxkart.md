***SuperTuxKart*** is a free and open-source 3D racing game featuring open-source project mascots as the racers. It was forked from the now unmaintained source code of TuxKart in late 2004, which is soon after disagreements lead to the end of TuxKart's development. In order to win races players must reach the finishing lines first, or follow a leader, or reach the finishing line within a specified amount of time, depending on the specific race. Users can run custom races just for fun (against either the computer or against up to four human opponents), or they can play in story mode. In story mode the user gains points by finishing races (which have adjustable difficulty settings, with easier races granting less points), with extra points users can unlock extra races and racetracks (and these racetracks can also be played as custom races, outside story mode) and once they all the story mode races are complete one can unlock a door in story mode (what comes after this door is something I do not know, yet!).

This is a game I have personally found rather enjoyable, although I would say its graphics are lower quality than that of *0 A.D.* and *RuneScape*'s NXT client.
