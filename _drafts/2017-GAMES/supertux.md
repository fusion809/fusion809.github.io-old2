***SuperTux*** is a free and open-source, cross-platform arcade game that is most similar to the proprietary *Super Mario Bros* game. In it one guides the hero, Tux, through a series of obstacles. Its graphics are 2D and hence graphics quality is not a major concern for the game. Presently there are two major variants of the game: milestone 1 (which was released in 2003) and milestone 2 (first stable release of which was in December 2015). Milestone 1 uses far less resources (like CPU, GPU and RAM) and is a 32-bit game. Only milestone 1 is available for FreeBSD. Milestone 2 uses a lot more resources, but has more features to it.

It is one of my favourite games, as while it is simple on paper it can be an entertaining challenge. One can create one's own maps for the game and otherwise customize it. One can play it with a joystick or just with a mouse.
