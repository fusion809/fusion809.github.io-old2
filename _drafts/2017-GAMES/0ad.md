***0 A.D.*** is a free and open-source, cross-platform, historic real-time strategy (RTS) game. In it, the player is the leader of an ancient civilization and they must defeat their opponents by amassing a sufficiently large military force. Its name is a deliberate misnomer, as the year *0 A.D.* never existed, rather 1 B.C. was the year directly before 1 A.D. The ancient civilizations that can be lead, or played against, in *0 A.D.* are those that were present between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D.

It can be played as a single player, or one can play against other players. In single player mode one can play against bots and leader-less teams. By leader-less teams I mean there is no bot leading the team, the people belonging to these teams only behave per the default behaviour. For example, if they are attacked they usually attack back; if they see your people, they may also attack if they are a military unit; otherwise they stay still and do nothing. There are two different bots one can play against: Petra Bot and Tutorial AI. For each bots there are six levels of difficulty one can set them to (sandbox, very easy, easy, medium, hard and very hard). *0 A.D.* has several maps on which one can play, there are mods available for the game (with different civilizations available, for example, there is a mod for Asian civilizations).

It utilizes its very own Pyrogenesis game engine; both *0 A.D.* and the Pyrogenesis game engine are written in C++. *0 A.D.*'s graphics are perhaps the best of any open-source Linux-compatible game I have ever seen. In fact, its graphics rival that of many proprietary games like *Age of Empires III* (AoE III) and *RuneScape*. I would argue that *0 A.D.*'s graphics are superior to that of AoE III, as I have used both and found *0 A.D.*'s graphics better. *0 A.D.* is developed by Wildfire Games, an international team of volunteer developers, funded by Software in the Public Interest, Inc. (SPI), a U.S. non-profit organization that also funds several other open-source software projects including Arch Linux, Debian and LibreOffice.{% include_relative fn-inline.html no="3" %}

### Packaging details
Most Linux distributions split *0 A.D.* into two packages, that are often named `0ad` and `0ad-data`, respectively. The `0ad` package usually provides the game engine while `0ad-data` provides the game content. Together these two packages are usually over 1.5 GB in installed size on most distributions. To illustrate this fact here is a command I ran on Gentoo Linux (on 1 May 2017) and below it is the output:

*0 A.D.* is one of the easiest games to get on Linux, the majority of Linux distributions have a *0 A.D.* package in their official repositories (usually named `0ad`, with game content placed in a separate package called `0ad-data`), including:{% include_relative fn-inline.html no="4" puncr="," %}{% include_relative fn-inline.html no="5" %}
