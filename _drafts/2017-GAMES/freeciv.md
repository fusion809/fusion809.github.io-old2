***Freeciv*** is a free and open-source turn-based strategy (TBS) game that resembles early versions of Sid Meier's Civilization. Its graphics are of low-quality and it supports both 2D and 3D graphics. In it users build their own civilization and fight opposing teams. I personally have never seen the appeal to TBS games, so I have hardly used Freeciv. It has both a standalone client and a web-based client through which one can play the game.
