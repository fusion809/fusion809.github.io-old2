***Battle for Wesnoth*** (***BfW***) is a free and open-source, incredibly cross-platform turn-based strategy game with a high fantasy theme. I personally dislike all turn-based strategy games, aside from those that are also board games like chess, so I have limited experience with it, but enough information to do a brief overview. In *BfW* users usually fight for the throne of *Wesnoth*, hence the name of the game, although other game goals are also available, for further details on these goals see the [*Description*](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Description) article at the *Wesnoth Wiki*. In it the user can play against the computer or other users.  The game is played on a [hex map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_map) with low-quality graphics.
