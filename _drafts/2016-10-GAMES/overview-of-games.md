As a Linux user, occasionally I need a means to pass the time, and as such I have tried quite a few **Linux games**. Linux has not traditionally been seen as a gaming platform, although in recent years this has changed significantly. Proprietary games are amongst the most popular (and include Minecraft, RuneScape and Steam games), but I prefer to avoid discussing proprietary software because I want *The Hornery* to be free of advertisement for proprietary products. Despite this there are plenty of open-source games for Linux. My personal favourites are, in alphabetical order:

* [0 A.D.](https://play0ad.com)
* [OpenRA](http://www.openra.net/)
* [SuperTux](http://supertux.github.io/)

In this article I will discuss each Linux game I have experience with, and compare them with respect to a few characteristics such as:

* Graphics quality.
* Ease of installation.
* Popularity.
* Genre.

## 0 A.D.

**0 A.D.** is a real-time strategy game developed by a team of volunteers known as Wildfire Games.
