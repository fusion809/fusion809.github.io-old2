I have been a Linux user for the past four years, and while I do endulge in using the odd closed-source game such as RuneScape, I still prefer open-source games. There are several reasons for this, firstly I believe in the principles behind open-source software and I agree that ideally software should be open-source. As that way, every one can learn from and improve on the source code. Secondly, open-source software is also usually (but not necessarily) free of monetary charge and I personally agree with Canonical[^1] in thinking that software should available free of charge and that software companies should instead rely on selling technical support to bring in their profits. Third, reporting bugs is usually easier with open-source software, as most have their source code hosted on GitHub, SourceForge or their own self-hosted version-control system repository. On a daily, or semi-daily, basis I usually use the following open-source games:

* [0 A.D.](#0ad)
* [AisleRiot Patience](#aisleriot-patience)
* [Mahjongg](#mahjongg)
* [OpenRA](#openra)
* [SuperTux](#supertux)
