On [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution), along with other [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)/[Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems,[^1] the command-line is a pivotal way by which users can interact with the operating system, the files stored on it and the system's various components. The command-line on such systems is usually accessed via so called &ldquo;**[terminal emulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)**&rdquo;, which start and allow users to interact with their [**Unix shell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell). It is Unix shells that really serve as the command-line of &#42;nix systems and from within them various command-line programs can be called and used to perform specific tasks. Examples of such programs include `cp`, `find`, `ls`, `rm`, *etc.* In fact, one of the defining properties of all &#42;nix systems is that they share a set of basic command-line utilities that perform specific and usually singular tasks. On Linux platforms these basic utilities are usually provided by the [**GNU Core Utilities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities) package and the Unix shell used is usually [**Bash**](#bash).

Along with the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) and the basic Unix commands, I would rank a Unix shell as one of the four most important components of any Linux distribution. Without it one's ability to interact one's system would be very limited and difficult.

In this post I will give provide an introduction to the &#42;nix command-line, including some available terminal emulators, Unix shells, with some focus on the two Unix shells I have the greatest experience with Bash and Zsh. It is important to remember I am not an expert on Unix shells, shell scripting or any programming language for that matter, I have even had doubts I could even write this blog post. It is important to note too that this post is nowhere near *comprehensive* on this topic, as the only type of text I, or anyone, could write that would be comprehensive on this topic would be an entire several-hundred page book, not a dozen-or-so-page blog post. This post just gives you some of the tools to do many of the basic things a novice or intermediate user of Linux would like to be able to do with their Unix shell.
