## Shell Scripts
I also maintain several GitHub repositories of shell scripts which I use on a variety of different Linux distributions to automate package management and other tasks. They are listed below; the legend is that a Q superscript denotes that this repo has a quick-install script (for quick deployment), while a Z superscript denotes that this repo also has support for the Zsh Unix shell.

* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="arch-scripts" sup="Q,Z" %} &mdash; scripts for distributions that use the pacman package manager, such as Arch Linux / Frugalware Linux / KaOS / Manjaro Linux.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="centos-scripts" %} &mdash; scripts for distributions that use the yum package manager, such as CentOS and Scientific Linux.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="debian-scripts" %} &mdash; scripts for distributions that use the APT or APT-RPM package managers, such as Debian and PCLinuxOS, respectively.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="fedora-scripts" sup="Q,Z" %} &mdash; scripts for Fedora-based distributions that have started using the DNF package manager.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="freebsd-scripts" %} &mdash; scripts for FreeBSD-based distributions that use the `pkg` package manager.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="gentoo-scripts" sup="Q,Z" %} &mdash; scripts for Gentoo-based distributions that use the Portage package manager, including Calculate, Frugalware and Gentoo Linux.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="mageia-scripts" %} &mdash; scripts for distributions that use the urpmi package manager, including Mageia and OpenMandriva.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="opensuse-scripts" sup="Q,Z" %} &mdash; scripts for distributions that use the ZYpp package manager like openSUSE.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="sabayon-scripts" sup="Q,Z" %} &mdash; scripts for distributions that use the Entropy package manager, such as Sabayon Linux and Spike.
