## Preference Repositories
The following repositories contain my application preferences, usually stored in config files. I store them here, as sort of a more public equivalent to a DropBox or Google Drive, in case of the relatively frequent occurrence of me changing distributions.

* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="atom" %} &mdash; pretty self-explanatory, this repo contains some of the more important files I have stored in `~/.atom`, which contain my Atom preferences.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="spacemacs" %} &mdash; my `~/.spacemacs` file, which contains all my [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) preferences.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="vim" %} &mdash; my `~/.vimrc` file, which contains my Vim preferences.
