<ul>
	<li><strong>Background</strong>: relevant history and technical details of the TE/IDE.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: How customizable is the TE. Are there themes, plugins, extensions, <em>etc.</em> available for the TE?  Is it possible to customize the TE/IDE with user-supplied scripts.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: What other features does the TE/IDE have? Like how many different computer languages does it offer syntax highlighting and auto-indentation for.</li>
	<li><strong>Obtaining it</strong>: how can one get the TE/IDE on Manjaro and Sabayon?</li>
	<li><strong>Advantages (Pros)</strong>/<strong>Disadvantages (Cons)</strong>: this is where I will summarize the positive and negative points of the previous sections as well as discuss how easy it is to use the TE.</li>
	<li><strong>Summary</strong>: this is where I provide a numerical rating for each of the following points (from 0 to 10, 0 being awful/non-existent, 10 being perfect):
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: how easy it is to get the TE/IDE on Manjaro and Sabayon. A score of 10 would mean that the text editor is pre-installed on a default Manjaro and Sabayon installation. While a score of 8 would mean that it is possible to install the package quite easily with Entropy.</li>
    	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: how steep is the learning curve of using this TE/IDE? That is, how difficult would it be for me, a non-programmer, to get to know this TE/IDE enough to write scripts in it, within an hour of first trying it?</li>
    	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: how easily and extensively customizable the TE/IDE is.</li>
    	<li><strong>Features</strong>: how extensive is the TE's syntax-highlighting cover of computer languages (that is, what proportion of computer languages can the TE/IDE do syntax highlighting for?). Does the TE/IDE also have IDE-type features such as in-built Python terminal, or shell terminal, <em>etc?</em></li>
			<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: how much experience with this TE/IDE do I have? 1 will indicate I have no experience with the TE/IDE, aside from that required to get the screenshot at the start of this review. Consequently, all information in this review will be based on my background research using sources such as the program's homepage.</li>
    	<li><strong>System resource usage</strong> (<strong>SRU</strong>): how much CPU/RAM does this TE/IDE use? How much disk space does it take up? How much brandwidth is taken up downloading it? All Manjaro-related information in this section will be specific to the 64-bit version of this OS. Yet again I will be using <code>ps_mem</code> to assess RAM usage on both Manjaro and Sabayon.</li>
    	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: overall how satisfied am I with this TE/IDE?</li>
    </ul>
