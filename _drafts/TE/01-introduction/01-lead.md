This post will cover some of *my favourite* **text editors** (**TEs**) and **integrated development environments** (**IDEs**). It is not meant to be a comprehensive overview of text editors and IDEs and rather just goes over some of my favourite ones. All of them are available free of monetary charge and all but one of them is also open-source. They are also all cross-platform and capable of running on Linux, OS X and Windows, although provided they can run on my favourite Linux distributions I do not really care about their ability to run on other platforms. These TEs and IDEs are:
