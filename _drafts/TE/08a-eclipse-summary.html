<ul>
  <li><strong>Availability</strong>: 7-8.</li>
  <li><strong>Beginner-Friendliness</strong>: 8. It seems fairly intuitive from my limited experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 8. I have not used it, for anymore than a couple of minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Features</strong>: 8.</li>
  <li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 1-2.</li>
  <li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 1-2. The new installer is a 43.6 MB download and when installed Eclipse should take up at least 110 MB (exact figures are not available). Eclipse 4.5.1 (Java edition) <code>ps_mem</code> table on Sabayon is: {% include Code/gist.html id="a9a62ebb56651844832a" %} On Manjaro it (specifically <code>eclipse-common</code>, which is the bare minimum of the IDE) is 108 MB, when installed, download size is 99.5 MB and this is my <code>ps_mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="bc06e7b0cb72b31e4465" %}</li>
  <li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8. Its high SRU is a significant disadvantage.</li>
