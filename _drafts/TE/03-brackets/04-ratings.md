### Ratings

* **Availability**: 3.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: ~9. It is a fairly beginner-friendly editor when used within its scope of web development.
* **Customizability**: 7. Some customization can be done via plugins, although the editor is designed just for web development so there is only so much customization you can do with it.
* **Features**: ~8.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 8. Bugs are its main issue, but otherwise it is fairly light.
* **Overall**: 7. In my books the fact it is difficult to get on most distributions and that its scope is limited to web development, is a weakness of this particular editor.
