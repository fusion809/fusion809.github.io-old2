### Ratings

* **Availability**: 6. My installer should make its installation easier.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: ~9. It is a fairly beginner-friendly editor when used within its scope of web development.
* **Customizability**: 7. Some customization can be done via plugins, although the editor is designed just for web development so there is only so much customization you can do with it.
* **Features**: ~8.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 6. Bugs are its main issue, but otherwise it is fairly light. The installed size of Brackets 1.6 (built from the [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/brackets/PKGBUILD) in my GitHub repository) on Arch Linux is 138.38 MB. For me it used 259.9 MB RAM while opened to my JScripts GitHub repository, with no optional (that is, those that do not come pre-installed with Brackets) plugins installed.
* **Overall**: 7. In my books the fact it is difficult to get on most distributions and that its scope is limited to web development, is a weakness of this particular editor.
