The **Brackets** text editor is a free and open-source (MIT-licensed) text editor developed by Adobe and built using web technologies. Brackets is unlike most other editors compared in this post in that it is specifically designed for web development and is not intended for general-purpose programming or text editing like Atom, Komodo Edit or VSCode. Brackets is built using its own framework ([Brackets Shell][2]), much like Atom with its Electron framework and Komodo Edit with its Firefox backbone. Brackets also uses the GTK+ 2 toolkit on Linux. 

Brackets is designed to be a **lightweight editor**, the biggest problem with it, in my opinion, is that it has **difficulty handling large numbers of files** (even when those files are all opened by the editor, but just present in the directory the editor is opened to) like that present in most git repositories. I have found that I cannot use it to edit *The Hornery* due to this very issue. Brackets is also known to be missing some features on Linux that it has while working on the more popular proprietary operating systems, OS X and Windows NT.
