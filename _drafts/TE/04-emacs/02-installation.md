### Installation
GNU Emacs is easily installed on most (if not all) Linux distributions as it is found in the official software repositories of most distributions. Distributions with it in their official repositories include:[^1]

* **Arch Linux**
* **CentOS**
* **Debian**
* **Fedora**
* **Gentoo Linux**
* **Linux Mint**
* **Mageia**
* **Manjaro Linux**
* **openSUSE**
* **Sabayon Linux**
* **Ubuntu**

[^1]: But are not limited to, if I listed every single distribution with emacs in their official repositories I would be here all day.
