#### General
Emacs's **general merits** include:

* In-built support for **running git commands** without a terminal.
* **Syntax-highlighting** for a **wide range** of different **computer languages**. Languages that are not supported by default can be supported by the installation of optional packages.
* In-built **terminal buffer** for running shell commands. I use the [`term-toggle`](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/term-toggle.el) package to make it easier to toggle the terminal buffer.
* **Web browser buffer** for searching the web, this is not in-built (that is, it does not come bundled with Emacs, by default). Further information on this can be found [here](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryWebBrowser) at the *EmacsWiki*.
* **File manager**, you can get an embedded file manager within Emacs using the [`neotree`](https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree) package.
