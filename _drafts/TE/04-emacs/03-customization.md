### Customization
Virtually every facet of Emacs' appearance and behaviour can be customized via modifying its configuration script, `~/.emacs`, or by installing extra packages. In fact, from what I hear[^2] Emacs is more extendable than Vim. In my opinion, however, the Emacs Lisp language is more complicated than the CoffeeScript, CSS, JavaScript and Less computer languages that Atom is extended with. I also find it more difficult to understand than the Vim script (or VimL) language used to extend Vim. Although, as always, it is really dependent on the individual in question as to which language(s) are more or less complicated, with respect to Emacs Lisp.

I personally use the [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) package, which gives Emacs a new (in my opinion, better) look and turns it into a modal editor like Vim. It also changes the default configuration script from `~/.emacs` to `~/.spacemacs`. If you would like to see my Spacemacs file see [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/fusion809/spacemacs) of mine.

[^2]: Keeping in mind that this is second-hand knowledge, not my own, as I simply do not understand Emacs Lisp or VimL enough to know this in my own right.
