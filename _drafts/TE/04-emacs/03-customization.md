### Customization
Virtually every facet of Emacs' appearance and behaviour can be customized via modifying its configuration script, `~/.emacs`, or by installing extra packages. In fact, from what I hear[^2] Emacs is more extendable than Vim. 

[^2]: Keeping in mind that this is second-hand knowledge, not my own, as I simply do not understand Emacs Lisp or VimL enough to know this in my own right.
