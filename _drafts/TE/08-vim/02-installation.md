### Installation
Vim, both its command-line and graphical variants, is easy to install on the vast majority of Linux distributions via one's package manager, as well as many &#42;BSD derivatives such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. The latest version of Vim at the time of writing is 7.4 (which was released in 2013), although patches (that are designed to make minor improvements on the editor and fix bugs) are released on a semi-daily basis. The latest patch version at the time of writing is number >1800 (making the overall latest version of Vim >7.4.1800). Most Linux distributions have at least Vim 7.4.300 in their official repositories.
