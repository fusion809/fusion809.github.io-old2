**Vim** is a free and incredibly extensible text editor that can be run from both the command-line and as a graphical editor called gVim. gVim is built using the GTK+ toolkit, one can pass configure flags before its build to set which version of GTK+ (that is, GTK+ 2 vs. GTK+ 3) is used to built the graphical editor. It is licensed under its own charityware license that while free and open-source encourages users to give money to orphans in Uganda. Vim is written in C and its own programming language, through which the editor can be extended, Vim script (VimL). It is developed predominantly by one person named Bram Moolenar, who uses GitHub for source code hosting and revision control. Vim is a fairly lightweight, using fairly minimal hard disk space and RAM and having a negligible start-up time.
