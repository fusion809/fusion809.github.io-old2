### Merits and Features
Vim is extensible via plugins written in VimL, these plugins are enabled by using plugin managers like [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). You can install extra plugins via editing your `~/.vimrc` file. Some plugins I know and love include:

* [**NERDTree**](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), a plugin that adds an embedded file browser into Vim. 

You can run terminal commands in it using the `:! <COMMAND>` command (where `<COMMAND>` is to be replaced with your shell command(s)).
