This post will cover some of *my favourite* **text editors** (**TEs**) and **integrated development environments** (**IDEs**). It is not meant to be a comprehensive overview of text editors and IDEs and rather just goes over some of my favourite ones. All of them are available free of monetary charge and all but one of them is also open-source. They are also all cross-platform and capable of running on Linux, OS X and Windows, although provided they can run on my favourite Linux distributions I do not really care about their ability to run on other platforms. These TEs and IDEs are:

{% capture content %}
* [**Atom**](#atom)
* [**Brackets**](#brackets)
* [**GNU Emacs**](#gnu-emacs)
* [**Komodo Edit**](#komodo-edit)
* [**LightTable**](#lighttable)
* [**Sublime Text**](#sublime-text)
* [**Vim**](#vim)
* [**Visual Studio Code**](#visual-studio-code)
{% endcapture %}
{% include Layouts/column.html no="3" content=content %}

For each TE/IDE I will mention their merits with respect to:

* **General text editing** &mdash; how wide a range of markup/programming/style sheet languages does this editor support, in terms of syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, auto-completion, *etc.*? How many general-purpose features does this editor have like does it have an embedded terminal
* **Blog writing** &mdash; how comprehensive is this editor's support for markup/style sheet/web programming languages? Does it have the in-built ability to run SSG servers and deploy a SSG-powered site? Can it do grammar/spell-checking or markup language previews? Does it have an embedded web browser for previewing the changes to your site you have made in it? 
* **Programming** / **Software development** &mdash; how many IDE features does this editor have? Like the ability to manage version control systems, project-building/script-running tasks, debug code, diagnose program problems, *etc.*
