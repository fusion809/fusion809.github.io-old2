This post will cover some of *my favourite* **text editors** (**TEs**) and **integrated development environments** (**IDEs**). It is not meant to be a comprehensive overview of text editors and IDEs and rather just goes over some of my favourite ones. All of them are available free of monetary charge and all but one of them is also open-source. They are also all cross-platform and capable of running on Linux, OS X and Windows, although provided they can run on my favourite Linux distributions I do not really care about their ability to run on other platforms. These TEs and IDEs are:

{% capture content %}
* [**Atom**](#atom)
* [**Brackets**](#brackets)
* [**GNU Emacs**](#gnu-emacs)
* [**Komodo Edit**](#komodo-edit)
* [**LightTable**](#lighttable)
* [**Sublime Text**](#sublime-text)
* [**Vim**](#vim)
* [**Visual Studio Code**](#visual-studio-code)
{% endcapture %}
{% include Layouts/column.html no="3" content=content %}

For each TE/IDE I will mention their merits with respect to:

* **General text editing** &mdash; how wide a range of markup/programming/style sheet languages does this editor support, in terms of syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, auto-completion, *etc.*? How many general-purpose features does this editor have like does it have an embedded terminal
* **Blog writing** &mdash; how comprehensive is this editor's support for markup/style sheet/web programming languages? Does it have the in-built ability to run SSG servers and deploy a SSG-powered site? Can it do grammar/spell-checking or markup language previews? Does it have an embedded web browser for previewing the changes to your site you have made in it?
* **Programming** / **Software development** &mdash; how many IDE features does this editor have? Like the ability to manage version control systems, project-building/script-running tasks, debug code, diagnose program problems, *etc.*

I will also provide a section providing numerical ratings (out of 10; 1 being the worst/non-existent and 10 being perfect) as to the following characteristics of the editor in question:

* **Availability** (**AV**): how easy is it to obtain this text editor on most Linux distributions? If it is in the official software repositories of most popular Linux distributions and can be easily installed from them it will earn a 10 here. If it is only available to those that are willing to compile its source code manually themselves and go through the whole troubleshooting process associated with this when something goes wrong, it will likely earn a 1-3.
* **Beginner-Friendliness** (**BF**): how easy is it to use this text editor efficiently? How much of a learning curve does this editor have? Is the level of effort and commitment you need to put into learning how to use this editor similar to that you would spend getting a bachelor degree at university?
* **Customizability** (**CMB**): how easily and extensively can this editor be customized and extended in its capabilities?
* **Stability & System Resource Usage** (**SSRU**): this is a composite of how long it takes for this editor to start up, how much CPU/RAM it uses once running, how stable it is once running and how great the program's installed size is.
* **Overall** (**OA**): how impressed or satisfied am I with this editor?
