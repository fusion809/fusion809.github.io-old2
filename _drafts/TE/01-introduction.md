**Text editors** (**TEs**) are essential tools for software developers, blog writers, note-tackers and people working in numerous other fields. This post covers *some* free text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) that are available for Linux. This post will not cover every text editor and IDE that is available (for a post that does this, for free and open-source TEs and IDEs, at least, see [*A Comparison of Free and Open-Source Text Editors and IDEs for Manjaro and Sabayon Linux*](/comparison-of-text-editors/)), but it will cover those I have taken a particular liking to. Only one proprietary, but free (as in freeware, that is, it costs the end-user nothing to use it legally, but it is licensed under a proprietary license) TE will be compared, namely Sublime Text, all other TEs and IDEs compared will be free and open-source. TEs and IDEs to be compared include:
