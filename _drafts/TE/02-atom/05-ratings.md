* **Availability**: 7. Official binary releases exist for most popular 64-bit distributions. Unofficial repositories containing Atom exist for most other popular distributions (e.g., Atom can be installed from the Arch User Repository for Arch/Manjaro users). My installer should (hopefully) make this installation process easier.

* **Customizability**: 9. Very customizable.
* **Features**: 9.
