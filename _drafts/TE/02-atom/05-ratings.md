### Ratings

* **Availability**: 7. Official binary releases exist for most popular 64-bit distributions. Unofficial repositories containing Atom exist for most other popular distributions (e.g., Atom can be installed from the Arch User Repository for Arch/Manjaro users). My installer should (hopefully) make this installation process easier.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: 9. Considering its feature-set it is very beginner-friendly.
* **Customizability**: 9. Very customizable.
* **Features**: 9.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 4. On Arch Linux Atom 1.7.3 had the installed size of 222.91 MiB, where Atom was built from a [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/tree/master/atom-editor) in my GitHub repository. The amount of RAM it used while running in safe mode (where no packages or themes, beyond the in-built or bundled ones are loaded) was 276.5 MB for one window and one tab. 
* **Overall**: 9.
