### Ratings

* **Availability**: 7. Official binary releases exist for most popular 64-bit distributions. Unofficial repositories containing Atom exist for most other popular distributions (e.g., Atom can be installed from the Arch User Repository for Arch/Manjaro users). My installer should (hopefully) make this installation process easier.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: 9. Considering its feature-set it is very beginner-friendly.
* **Customizability**: 9. Very customizable, such customization can be done via plugins or via editing one's style sheet/config script/init script/keymap/... in one's `~/.atom` folder. 
* **Features**: 9.
