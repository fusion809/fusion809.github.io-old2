### Installation
VSCode can be installed via a number of different methods, although it is not in the official repositories of any Linux distribution I am aware of. The closest thing to a distribution with VSCode in its official repositories that I have come across is Arch Linux, which has VSCode (provided by several different packages) in the Arch User Repository. To simplify the installation process I have created my own shell installer for VSCode (GitHub repository: [VScode-installer](https://github.com/fusion809/VScode-installer)). It provides users with two main options, for most Linux distributions, they are:

* Install from a binary package (usually a Debian or RPM package provided by Microsoft)
* Install from source code
