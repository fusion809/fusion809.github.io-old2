### Ratings

* **Availability**: 7.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: ~8.
* **Customizability**: 8.
* **Features**: 8-9. Fairly feature-packed, but unfortunately no embedded terminal.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 7. The installed size of Visual Studio Code 1.1.1 (built from the [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/visual-studio-code-oss/PKGBUILD) in my GitHub repository) on Arch Linux is 131.43 MiB. For me it used just 486.5 MB RAM when running, opened to a single file with a single working directory.
* **Overall**: 8.
