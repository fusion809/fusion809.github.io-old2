**LightTable** is a free and open-source IDE written in Clojure that is primarily intended for web development. It is built on the Electron framework too. So far it is in beta development, without a 1.0 release so far. Something that is unique about it is that it is fairly architecture-independent with an official binary tarball released for each new version that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. I have created a cross-distribution installer for LightTable on Linux and the major drama with installing it, in my opinion, is getting the dependencies. These dependencies are usually fairly old and out-dated (like the system library libudev.so.0) and hence can be challenging to get on newer distributions.
