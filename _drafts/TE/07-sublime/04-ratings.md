### Ratings

* **Availability**: 8. The Debian and tarball binaries make it fairly easy to install on Linux.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: ~8. It is a fairly beginner-friendly editor.
* **Customizability**: 8-9.
* **Features**: ~8. Fairly feature-packed, but unfortunately no embedded terminal.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 7-8. The installed size of Sublime Text 3.3103 (built from the [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/sublime-text-dev/PKGBUILD) in my GitHub repository) on Arch Linux is 16.35 MiB. For me it used 92.2 MB RAM while opened to my hexo-site GitHub repository, with no optional (that is, those that do not come pre-installed with Brackets) plugins installed.
* **Overall**: 8. Its being proprietary-licensed is its main weakness, in my opinion.
