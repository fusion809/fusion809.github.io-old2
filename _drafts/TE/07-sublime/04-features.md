### Merits and Features
Sublime Text has in-built syntax-highlighting for the vast majority of popular computer languages out there. As mentioned earlier Sublime Text's feature set can be extended using plugins. There are some limitations, for one, there is no embedded browser available for previews or no embedded terminal emulator.
