### Installation
Komodo Edit while not in the official repositories of any Linux distribution I am aware of, can be easily installed on x86 and x86_64 Linux systems from the binary tarball releases on the Komodo Edit home page. You can browse available binary tarballs [here](http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/releases/), although beware half of the binary tarballs are for Komodo IDE.
