### Ratings

* **Availability**: 7. This is mostly thanks to my installer and official binary tarball releases.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: ~8. It is a fairly beginner-friendly editor.
* **Customizability**: 7. Some customization can be done via plugins, but as its is the free version of a proprietary editor some customization is off-limit.
* **Features**: ~8.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 6. Bugs are its main issue, but otherwise it is fairly light. The installed size of Komodo Edit 9.3.2 (built from the [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/komodo-edit/PKGBUILD) in my GitHub repository) on Arch Linux is 243.92 MiB. For me it used 219.8 MB RAM while opened to my hexo-site GitHub repository, with no optional (that is, those that do not come pre-installed with Brackets) plugins installed.
* **Overall**: 7. Its limited customizability is its main weakness.
