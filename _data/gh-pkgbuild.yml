      notes:     "While an <code>atom-editor</code> AUR package does exist, it, as of the addition of an <code>atom</code> to the <code>[community]</code> repository, is frequently out-of-date. Plus, this custom <code>atom-editor</code> PKGBUILD has some custom packages installed instead of the default."
