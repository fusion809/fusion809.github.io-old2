    description:
            "This category is for repositories with a quick-install script (usually entitled `quick-install.sh`), which *should* (if they fail, feel free to start a new issue and report this fact and I will see what I can do about it) quickly install the repository on one's machine. For example, the `arch-scripts` quick-install script replaces `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` (for both root and standard user) with those from this repository, sets Zsh as the default shell, installs oh-my-zsh and gets one's system ready to use these scripts."

If the Zsh category is included also then this means the shell script repository in question contains both `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`, if not then only the `~/.bashrc` is provided by this repository."
