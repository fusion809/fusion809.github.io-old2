    Meaning: "Cleans the temporary build directory for this ebuild."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild clean`"
  - Command: "`compile`"
    Meaning: "Compile the ebuild following the instructions in the `src_compile()` function."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild compile`"
  - Command: "`config`"
    Meaning: "Perform post-installation configuration specified in the `pkg_config()` function."
    Example: "`ebuild mysql-5.6.27-r1.ebuild config`"
  - Command: "`configure`"
    Meaning: "Configure the source code in the ${S} directory, by running the `src_configure()` function. Supported for EAPI &#8805;2."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild configure`"
  - Command: "`digest`/<br/>`manifest`"
    Meaning: "Produce a manifest for the ebuild."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild digest` <br/>**or** <br/>`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild manifest`"
  - Command: "`fetch`"
    Meaning: "Checks if the sources specified in `SRC_URI` are available in `DESTDIR`. If they are not available in `DESTDIR`, an attempt
    is made to download them."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild fetch`"
  - Command: "`help`"
    Meaning: "Shows condensed form of the ebuild(1) manpage, with information specified to the package specified."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild help`"
  - Command: "`install`"
    Meaning: "Installs the package to the temporary install directory by running the `src_install()` function. This will **not** install
    the package into your local filesystem, however."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild install`"
  - Command: "`merge`"
    Meaning: "Run the `fetch`, `unpack`, `compile`, `install` and `qmerge` functions, which should install the package into your live file
    system."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild merge`"
  - Command: "`package`"
    Meaning: "Essentially the equivalent to the `merge` command, except without installation into the live file system, rather the package
    is turned into a `.tbz2` binary and stored in `$PKGDIR` (usually `/usr/portage/packages`)."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild package`"
  - Command: "`postinst`"
    Meaning: "Runs `pkg_postinst()` function in ebuild, which normally runs after a package is install into the live file system."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild postinst`"
  - Command: "`postrm`"
    Meaning: "Runs `pkg_postrm()` function in ebuild, which is normally run after a package is unmerged."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild postrm`"
  - Command: "`preinst`"
    Meaning: "Runs the `pkg_preinst()` function which is usually run before the package is installed into the live file system."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild preinst`"
  - Command: "`prepare`"
    Meaning: "Runs `src_prepare()` function on extracted sources."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild prepare`"
  - Command: "`prerm`"

    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild prerm`"
  - Command: "`qmerge`"
    Meaning: "This function installs all the files in the install directory to the live file system."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild qmerge`"
  - Command: "`rpm`"
    Meaning: "Builds an RPM binary package from the files in the temporary install directory."

  - Command: "`setup`"
    Meaning: "Runs the `pkg_setup()` function."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild setup`"
  - Command: "`test`"
    Meaning: "Runs the `src_test()` function."
    Example: "`ebuild atom-1.3.1.ebuild test`"
  - Command: "`unmerge`"
