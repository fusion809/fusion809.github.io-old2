{% include Links/links.html package="games-strategy/openra" program="OpenRA" link="http://www.openra.net/" wp="OpenRA" gr="OpenRA/OpenRA" wiki="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki" %} is a free and open-source futuristic strategy game. For me, it reminds me of one of my favourite Windows games, [Outlive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlive). OpenRA is unusual in that it is not available in the Entropy Store, although a [few ebuilds](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-strategy/openra) for it do exist in the Portage Tree, although it is worthwhile mentioning that these ebuilds are often out of date. For example, as of 26 November 2015 the latest ebuild available in the Portage Tree was for version 20141029 (note how this number represents the date of the release, 29 October 2014), while the latest release was 20150919 (released 19 September 2015). There are unofficial overlays (such as [`games-overlay`](https://github.com/hasufell/games-overlay)) that contain more recent versions of OpenRA, although it was not until 19 October 2015 that an ebuild for 20150919 was added to this overlay.

To install the latest version available of OpenRA on Sabayon one has four main options:
