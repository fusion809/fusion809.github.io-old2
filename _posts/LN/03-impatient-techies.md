## Busy/Impatient Techies
If you have less free time to install and then configure your Linux system, but still want a great deal of freedom over your system and would like the very latest software then I think [**Arch Linux**](https://www.archlinux.org) will be the distribution for you. While it is still challenging for newcomers to set up Arch Linux, it is nowhere near as challenging as Gentoo is. Maintaining Arch Linux is also far simpler and easier, upgrading an Arch system is as simple as running a single command {% include Code/coders.html line1="pacman -Syu --noconfirm" %} from the command-line. I usually find the software in Arch's official repositories tends to be a little more up-to-date than the latest version in the Portage Tree. Although if you want to always have the latest Linux kernel, then I would suggest you use Gentoo Linux instead of Arch Linux, because I tend to find there is quite a delay between the release of the latest kernel and its addition to Arch's core repository. Although usually the latest kernel will be added to the Portage Tree within a few hours of being released. Although the Portage Tree took over two months to get the 3.18 release of GNOME, so I still stand by my previous statement that Arch's repository tends to be a little more up-to-date than that in the Portage Tree.

**Fedora** &mdash; it is the only distribution mentioned in this section that comes with an automated installer, which makes it easier to install. Despite this it is often said to be a developer's distribution, because it uses the very latest software for the most part. In fact Linus Torvalds, the developer of the Linux kernel, is said to use Fedora on all his PCs. Although I should warn you that it does **not** follow a rolling release model, so new releases need to be installed over older releases, which can become a pain seeing how a new release comes out roughly every six months.
