## Busy/Impatient Techies
**Arch Linux**, while it is still challenging for newcomers to set it up, it is nowhere near as challenging as Gentoo is. Maintaining Arch Linux is also far simpler and easier, upgrading an Arch system is as simple as running a single command {% include Code/coder.html line1="pacman -Syu --noconfirm" %} from the command-line. It also follows a rolling release model, generally speaking you will find Arch's software tends to be a little more up-to-date than Gentoo's, but I have seen software packages where the reverse is also true.
* **Fedora** &mdash; it is the only distribution mentioned in this section that comes with an automated installer, which makes it easier to install. Despite this it is often said to be a developer's distribution, because it uses the very latest software for the most part. In fact Linus Torvalds, the developer of the Linux kernel, is said to use Fedora on all his PCs. Although I should warn you that it does **not** follow a rolling release model, so new releases need to be installed over older releases, which can become a pain seeing how a new release comes out roughly every six months.
