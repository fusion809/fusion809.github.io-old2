**Arch Linux** is a bleeding-edge, rolling release, advanced user-oriented, minimal, independent Linux distribution. It uses the pacman package manager, which is written in C, Python and Shell. pacman is my personal favourite package manager, as it is very fast (in fact, the [fastest Linux package manager](/comparison-of-package-managers/)) and easy to build custom packages for. Arch Linux's software repositories mostly contain open-source software, but not exclusively (e.g., the [`nvidia`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/nvidia/) package) and its default kernel contains binary blobs. It has no official installer, and rather has to be installed manually from the command-line. This process is not ideal, especially if you are not used to it, but it is at least well-documented at *The ArchWiki* in the [*Installation guide*](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide).

Its stable (as opposed to the unstable/testing counterparts of these repositories) official software repositories include [`[community]`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?repo=Community), [`[core]`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?repo=Core), [`[extra]`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?repo=Extra) and [`[multilib]`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?repo=Multilib) (which only exists for x86-64 systems). The `[core]` repository contains the basic system software, like GNU core software, the Linux kernel and alike. Likewise the `[extra]` repository contains non-core software that is still fairly important and popular. This includes FFmpeg, VLC Media Player, popular desktop environments (such as GNOME, KDE and LXDE), including their respective suite of core application software, Mozilla Firefox, *etc.* The `[community]` repository contains miscellaneous other pieces of software that trusted users have decided to maintain. It is the largest of Arch Linux's official repositories. Most of the packages in the `[community]` repository originated from the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) (AUR) or unofficial GitHub repositories containing PKGBUILDs and other source files for building Arch Linux packages.

The AUR is another major plus of Arch Linux and its derivative distributions. The AUR contains PKGBUILDs and other source files for building (using pacman's `makepkg` utility) a wide range of different packages not provided by the official repositories. Several programs to aid in building and installing AUR packages exist, they are so called "AUR helpers" and are documented in [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers) ArchWiki article. I personally prefer to use pacaur, although, I have also used Trizen and Yaourt before.

A default, fresh installation of Arch Linux includes only the software in the [`base`](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/base/) group. This makes Arch Linux a minimalist distribution and means one can build one's own system from the ground-up. I personally like Arch Linux, for the most part, but I have found it buggy, which is not surprising given that it is a bleeding-edge distribution.
