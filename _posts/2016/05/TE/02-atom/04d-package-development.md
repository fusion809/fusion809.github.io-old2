#### Package Development
Atom also has a few packages that can make it an attractive editor for package developers and maintainers of certain Linux distributions. These distributions include:

* [**Arch Linux**](https://www.archlinux.org) / [**Manjaro Linux**](https://manjaro.github.io) &mdash; for Arch developers I recommend the installation of the {% include Atom/apm.md package="terminal-plus" %} package only. The bundled {% include Atom/apm.md package="language-shellscript" %} package automatically provides syntax highlighting for PKGBUILDs upon opening, so you need not worry about installing extra packages to provide the necessary syntax highlighting of PKGBUILDs. The `terminal-plus` package would likely be helpful as it allows you update package checksums from the command-line (using the `updpkgsums` command) and if you are more comfortable with running git commands from the command-line like I am it also allows you to commit your changes to Arch source files (like PKGBUILDs, install files, patch files, *etc.*).
* [**CentOS**](https://www.centos.org/) / [**Fedora**](https://getfedora.org) / [**openSUSE**](https://www.opensuse.org/) / **other RPM distributions** &mdash; RPM developers are probably best using the {% include Atom/apm.md package="language-rpm-spec" %} package for syntax highlighting of RPM spec files.
* [**Debian**](http://www.debian.org) / [**Ubuntu**](http://www.ubuntu.com/) / **other distributions using Debian packages** &mdash; Deb package developers may benefit from the {% include Atom/apm.md package="language-debian" %} package, as it provides grammars and snippets for Debian rules and control files. I have never used this package so I personally cannot comment on how helpful it really is.
* [**Gentoo Linux**](https://www.gentoo.org/) / [**Sabayon Linux**](https://www.sabayon.org) &mdash; Gentoo developers are probably best off installing the {% include Atom/apm.md package="language-gentoo" %} package as it allows them to more easily update ebuild manifests, provides syntax highlighting for ebuilds and allows one to test out ebuilds by building packages from them. Personally I think this is the best Atom package for package development out there, so Gentoo developers are certainly blessed when it comes to Atom.
