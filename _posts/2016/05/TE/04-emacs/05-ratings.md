### Ratings

* **Availability**: 10. Every Linux distribution I am familiar with has it in their official repositories.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: 4. Not quite as challenging for newcomers to use as Vim, in my opinion.
* **Customizability**: 9. Probably the single most configurable text editor available.
* **Features**: 9. I essentially think of it as a Swiss army knife, with several features built-in that are not usually associated with a text editor.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 7-8. Version 24.5-3 used 121.5 MB RAM on my Arch Linux machine, with Spacemacs installed. Its installed size was 99.43 MB.
* **Overall**: 7. Its low level of beginner-friendliness is a bit of a deal-breaker to me.
