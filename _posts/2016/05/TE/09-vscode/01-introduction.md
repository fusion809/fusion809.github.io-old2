**Visual Studio Code** (or **VSCode**) is a free (MIT-Licensed) text editor that is written in CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript and built using the Electron framework. It is developed by Microsoft, and while its source code is MIT-Licensed, pre-compiled Linux binaries for it are licensed under a proprietary End-User License Agreement (EULA). I only learnt about it through a friend, in fact, when I wrote the [*A Comparison of Free and Open-Source Text Editors and IDEs for Manjaro and Sabayon Linux*](/comparison-of-text-editors/) post I did not know about it. VSCode is designed to be a lighter-weight editor (although whether its developers succeeded in this, is a matter for debate) than more feature-packed editors like Atom, despite being fairly feature-filled. I personally think of VSCode as an inferior, yet similar product to Atom. The only respect I have found it superior to Atom is that it is has a grammar- and spell-checking package for markup files, as opposed to Atom which only has a spell-checker. Its inferiority is with respect to the fact that it does not have extensions that give it an embedded terminal. Plus it generally has fewer packages/themes than Atom.
