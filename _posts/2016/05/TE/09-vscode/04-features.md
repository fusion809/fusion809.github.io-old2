### Features
It has syntax-highlighting for the vast majority of programming, markup and stylesheet languages. It also has code auto-suggestions for a variety of programming languages. It also has in-built support for running git commands without a terminal, as well as an in-built debugger. Additionally it has an in-built file browser. By default, if more than one file is to be opened simultaneously, additional files will be opened in a new pane. Despite this, it has no tabs, no embedded terminal or web browser, not even with extensions can these capabilities be added. Although tabs are [planned](http://code.visualstudio.com/Updates#_editor) for a future release.
