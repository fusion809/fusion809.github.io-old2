### Merits and Features
Vim is extensible via plugins written in VimL, these plugins are enabled by using plugin managers like [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). You can install extra plugins via editing your `~/.vimrc` file. Some plugins I know and love include:

* [**fugitive.vim**](http://vimawesome.com/plugin/fugitive-vim), a plugin that adds git support for Vim.
* [**NERDTree**](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), a plugin that adds an embedded file browser into Vim.
* [**PKGBUILD.vim**](https://github.com/Firef0x/PKGBUILD.vim), a plugin that adds syntax-highlighting support for PKGBUILDs.
* [**spec.vim**](https://github.com/vim-scripts/spec.vim), a plugin that adds syntax-highlighting and snippets support for spec (file extension: `.spec`) files.
* [**vim-colors-solarized**](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized), a theme for Vim.

You can run terminal commands in it using the `:! <COMMAND>` command (where `<COMMAND>` is to be replaced with your shell command(s)). You can also add a tab bar to Vim to make it easier to switch between opened files using the [TabBar](https://github.com/vim-scripts/TabBar) plugin.
