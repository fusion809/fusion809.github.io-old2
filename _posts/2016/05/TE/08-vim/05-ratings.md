### Ratings

* **Availability**: 10. Available from official repositories of most Linux distributions and &#42;BSDs.
* **Beginner-Friendliness**: ~2. Odds are you will not even be able to use it at all until you learn more about this unique editor.
* **Customizability**: 9.
* **Features**: 8-9. Fairly feature-packed, but unfortunately no embedded terminal.
* **Stability & System Resource Usage**: 9. The installed size of gVim 7.4.1828 (built from the [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/gvim/PKGBUILD) in my GitHub repository) on Arch Linux is 28.98 MiB. For me it used just 15.6MB RAM with its GTK+ 3 GUI.  
* **Overall**: 8. Its lack of beginner-friendliness is its chief disadvantage, in my books.
