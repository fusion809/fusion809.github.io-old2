For each TE/IDE I will mention their merits with respect to:

* **General text editing** &mdash; how wide a range of markup/programming/style sheet languages does this editor support, in terms of syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, auto-completion, *etc.*? How many general-purpose features does this editor have? For example, does it have an embedded terminal?
* **Blog writing** &mdash; how comprehensive is this editor's support for markup/style sheet/web programming languages? Does it have the in-built ability to run SSG servers and deploy a SSG-powered site? Can it do grammar/spell-checking or markup language previews? Does it have an embedded web browser for previewing the changes to your site you have made in it?
* **Programming** / **Software development** &mdash; how many IDE features does this editor have? Like the ability to manage version control systems, project-building/script-running tasks, debug code, diagnose program problems, *etc.*
* **Package development** &mdash; how many tools exist specifically for helping Linux package developers.
