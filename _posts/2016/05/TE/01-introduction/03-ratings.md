I will also provide a section providing numerical ratings (out of 10; 1 being the worst/non-existent and 10 being perfect) as to the following characteristics of the editor in question:

* **Availability** (**AV**): how easy is it to obtain this text editor on most Linux distributions? If it is in the official software repositories of most popular Linux distributions and can be easily installed from them it will earn a 10 here. If it is only available to those that are willing to compile its source code manually themselves and go through the whole troubleshooting process associated with this when something goes wrong, it will likely earn a 1-3.
* **Beginner-Friendliness** (**BF**): how easy is it to use this text editor efficiently? How much of a learning curve does this editor have? Is the level of effort and commitment you need to put into learning how to use this editor similar to that you would spend getting a bachelor degree at university?
* **Customizability** (**CMB**): how easily and extensively can this editor be customized and extended in its capabilities?
* **Features** (**FT**): how extensive is its existing feature set?
* **Stability & System Resource Usage** (**SSRU**): this is a composite of how long it takes for this editor to start up, how much CPU/RAM it uses once running, how stable it is once running and how great the program's installed size is. The more CPU/RAM it uses, the larger its installed size and the more buggy it is the lower the rating. 
* **Overall** (**OA**): how impressed or satisfied am I with this editor?
