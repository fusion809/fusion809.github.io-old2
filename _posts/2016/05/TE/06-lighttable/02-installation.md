### Installation
As previously mentioned I have created a cross-distribution installer for LightTable. Its GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/fusion809/lighttable-installer). To use it, run:

{% include Code/codeu.html line1='/bin/bash -c "$(curl -sL https://git.io/vr3pT)"' %}

or:

{% include Code/codeu.html line1='/bin/bash -c "$(wget -cqO- https://git.io/vr3pT)"' %}
