Yesterday, 8 February 2016, I experienced an issue with Xorg / my graphics card on my Arch Linux installation after rebooting that prevented me from accessing SDDM, LightDM and the desktop environments I had set up (the exact time this was, would have been roughly 3-4 am, Australian Eastern Standard Time [AEST, or UTC+10]). I spent about an hour trying to fix it myself, guided by the ArchWiki documentation,  but then I asked for help at the [Arch Linux forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1602691) and instead of receiving the help I was looking for, I received rude treatment from one of the forum's admins and a series of failed solutions from others in the forum. If all I was getting was failed solutions, with no abuse, odds are I would have stuck it out for a while longer, as obviously no one is God, we all make mistakes as we do not know everything, so I was prepared for several failed attempts to fix my problem before an actual successful solution would come along, but I have had to deal with this sort of abuse or rudeness before on other Linux forums and I was sick of it, so I decided to jump ship to openSUSE Tumbleweed.

The natural question is "Why openSUSE Tumbleweed? Why not *distribution X*?" Well, there were several factors guiding my decision. They include:
1. I wanted a distribution that followed a rolling release model, as I loath having to upgrade systems that use a standard release model (e.g., for three years, as I have previously stated on this blog, I used Ubuntu and only Ubuntu, as my Linux distribution and it has to be upgraded like this every six months), as it always seems something gets broken in the process.
2. I was interested in a distribution for which there was a decently-sized team of developers maintaining its packages, repositories and other components, as I had past experience with a distribution with a small development team, Sabayon, and I knew from this distribution that no matter how "bleeding edge" they claim their system is, some packages inevitably slip through the cracks and become out-of-date.
3. I was searching for a fairly popular distribution as more popular distributions tend to have better free support, like online forums and IRC channels.
4. I wanted a distribution with an intuitive and easy-to-use automated installer, as while I had managed to install Arch without one, it made the process a little less straight-forward.
5. I wanted a distribution with enough stability so that I would never experience the graphics issues I had experienced with Arch Linux.
6. I was looking for a distribution with easy and fast package management, and an easy package development process so that I could create packages myself without having to put in so much effort that I may as well be getting a university degree for it.
openSUSE Tumbleweed was the only distribution that ticked each of these boxes.
