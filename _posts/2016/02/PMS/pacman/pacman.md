## pacman
[**pacman**](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/) is the default package manager of Arch Linux and its various derivatives as well as at least two supposedly &ldquo;independent&rdquo; distributions, Frugalware Linux and KaOS. It adheres quite strictly to the Arch philosophy of keeping it simple, at least to those that understand it well enough. See, its syntax is far from intuitive or straight-forward to a beginner, in fact, it can quite easily become confusing, but once one understands pacman and how it works well enough, it becomes clearer. It is written almost entirely in C and this likely contributes to the fact that it is probably the fastest Linux package manager available today. Its packages have the `.pkg.tar.xz` file extension and are generated by running the `makepkg` command (which is provided by the `pacman` package) in a directory in which a specialized Bash script called a PKGBUILD is located. Its first stable release was in February 2002.[^1]

### Beginner-Friendliness
As previously mentioned pacman has a syntax that is non-intuitive to newcomers, for example, to install a package one runs {% include Code/coders.html line1="pacman -S $package" %}, while to remove it one runs {% include Code/coders.html line1="pacman -Rsc $package" %}. If you are interested in making the transition from another package manager to pacman, I suggest you read the [Pacman/Rosetta](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Rosetta) article at *The ArchWiki*.

From {% include Code/coders.html line1="time pacman -S vim --noconfirm" directory="/home/fusion809" %} I got the output:
