## Entropy
**Entropy** is the default package manager of Sabayon, although Sabayon also comes with the [Portage](#portage) package manager pre-installed, but only the use of Entropy is supported by the Sabayon community. Entropy has similarities to Portage, along with several key differences. It is written in Python and shell script, like Portage, but unlike Portage, which, by default, installs software from source code following instructions found in ebuilds, Entropy installs software from binary packages. These binary packages were originally built using Portage, however, then they are converted to binary packages suitable for Entropy using Entropy itself (via {% include Code/coders-rbs.html line1="equo pkg inflate $package.tbz2" %} Entropy has both an official command-line and graphical user interface; from the command-line it is called by the [`equo`](/man/equo.1.html) command, while Rigo is its GUI. Entropy is the second-youngest package manager mentioned in this post, after DNF, with its first public release being in 2007 and its first stable release being in 2012.

Entropy is not a front-end for any lower-level package managers, unlike APT which is a front-end for dpkg and DNF which is a front-end for RPM.

### Beginner-Friendliness
It is a fairly beginner-friendly package manager, its command-line syntax is intuitive, for example, {% include Code/coders.html line1="equo install octave" %} should install GNU Octave, without prompting, while {% include Code/coders.html line1="equo remove octave" %} should uninstall it without prompting. The only prompting that Entropy does, unless you, the user, specify that it should by passing it the `--ask` or `-a` options to it, is asking if you accept any relevant package licenses that are not accepted by default. Its basic syntax is:
{% include Code/coder.html line1="equo [<i>action</i>] [option(s)] [<b>target</b>(<b>s</b>)]" no="2" space="61" %}
Several abbreviated actions exist, for example, `i` for `install`, `rm` for `remove`, `up` for `update` and `u` for `upgrade`. It has a graphical user interface which is always a nice beginner-friendly touch. Overall I would rate its beginner-friendliness at **8/10**.

### Customizability
As Entropy installs software from binary packages, there is no real freedom to customize the packages to your liking. Except by, of course, writing your own ebuild, or modifying existing ebuilds, to your liking and building and installing them. Or building/installing existing ebuilds in the Portage Tree or unofficial overlays with custom USE flags enabled. As far as customizing Entropy itself, there are several files in the `/etc/entropy` directory that can be used to customize Entropy's options.

### Development
Entropy package development is done in three major steps:

* The creation or selection of a suitable ebuild.
* The building of a Portage binary package from the ebuild by issuing the command {% include Code/coders-fs.html line1="ebuild $package.ebuild package" %} Or, if the ebuild is in a presently-enabled Portage overlay, run {% include Code/coders-fs.html line1="emerge -b $package" %} Where `$package.ebuild` is the name of the ebuild, including its file extensions, relative to the present working directory.
*  {% include Code/coders-fs.html line1="equo pkg inflate $package.tbz2" %} Where `$package.tbz2` is the binary package built by Portage, including its relative path to the present working directory. It is likely in the `/usr/portage/packages` directory.

If you wish to distribute your package (like in a repository), I am afraid you are left to your own devices. That is, the Open Build Service (OBS) does not store Entropy packages and there are no other free alternatives for hosting your package repositories that I am aware of, at least.

### Features
Syntactically it is similar to both APT and Portage. See its options (e.g., `-a/--ask` for ask for confirmation before performing changes) are similar to Portage, but its actions are largely borrowed from APT. It cannot install packages from a URL, although it can install software from local packages. If you install a local package, that is also present (even if the version present there is different) in the Entropy repositories, then perform an upgrade odds are the package version in the Entropy repositories will be installed over it. I found its output more detailed and descriptive than APT, however, and similar in quality to that of DNF/yum. It does not support wildcards and its packages are usually not split up the way Debian and RPM packages often are. It, like Portage, can install meta-packages that serve no other purpose than to draw in several pieces of related software. For example, running {% include Code/coders.html line1="equo i gnome-base/gnome" %} should install the core GNOME desktop components. It also has abbreviated commands (e.g., `equo i` is the equivalent to running `equo install`), which can come in handy.

### Speed
Running {% include Code/coders.html line1="time equo i vim" %} returned:

So it took **7.621s** total to reinstall this package. I personally think that this figure is not representative of its speed in practice, I think it is slower than all package managers except Portage and perhaps DNF and/or yum.
