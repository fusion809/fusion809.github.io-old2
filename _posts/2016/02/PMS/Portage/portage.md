## Portage
[**Portage**](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) is the default package manager of Gentoo Linux and many of its derivatives, including Calculate and Funtoo Linux. Unlike all other package managers mentioned in this post it works with source code packages, by default. As such there are several differences between it and other package managers, in term of how it operates. See its chief repository is found in the `/usr/portage` directory. It contains ebuilds, a specialized type of shell script, that contains instructions that Portage can use to build a binary software package and/or install the software package from source code or a binary package for another package manager (e.g., a Debian package or RPM package).
