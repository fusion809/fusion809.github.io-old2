## Portage
[**Portage**](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) is the default package manager of Gentoo Linux and many of its derivatives, including Calculate and Funtoo Linux. Unlike all other package managers mentioned in this post it works with source code packages, by default. As such there are several differences between it and other package managers, in term of how it operates. See its chief repository is found in the `/usr/portage` directory.
