## Portage
[**Portage**](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) is the default package manager of Gentoo Linux and many of its derivatives, including Calculate and Funtoo Linux. Unlike all other package managers mentioned in this post it works with source code packages, by default. As such there are several differences between it and other package managers, in term of how it operates. See its chief repository is found in the `/usr/portage` directory (the so called "Portage Tree"), which is structured similarly to the FreeBSD ports system and contains ebuilds, a specialized type of Bash script, along with patch files and Manifests (a file that contains checksums and file size information about ebuilds and other files). This structure is such that the top-level subdirectory of `/usr/portage` is for package categories like `app-editors` for text editors, `x11-wm` for window managers, *etc.*, the next lower level is for specific packages (e.g., `/usr/portage/app-editors/gvim` is where gVim ebuilds and related files can be found). ebuilds contains instructions that Portage can use to build a binary software package (in the `.tbz2` format) and/or install the software package from source code or a binary package from another distribution (e.g., Debian packages and RPM packages). Portage is written in Python 2 and Bash script.

### Beginner-Friendliness
Portage is probably the least beginner-friendly package management system mentioned in this post, its syntax is less than intuitive and quite frequently installing, removing and upgrading software is not as simple as running a single command. It has no official graphical front-ends, although an unofficial one called Porthole ([`app-portage/porthole`) is available from the Portage Tree.
