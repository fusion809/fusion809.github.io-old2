### Background
[**Fluxbox**](http://fluxbox.org/) is a stacking window manager originally forked from Blackbox 0.61 in 2001. It is primarily designed to be lightweight. Fluxbox can be customized by editing files in the `~/.fluxbox` directory. Customizations that are possible are of its keyboard shortcuts, application menu and startup applications.
