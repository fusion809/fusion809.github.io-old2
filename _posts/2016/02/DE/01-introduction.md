Almost all frequently-encountered modern **Linux distributions** (LDs) come with some pre-installed **graphical user interface** (GUI) by which users can interact with their system. The most popular types of GUI used by LDs are **desktop environments** (**DEs**) and **window managers** (**WMs**). DEs are by far the most popular GUIs and, by definition, are composed, partly, of WMs too. A precise, attempt at a definition of DEs and WMs, can be found in the [glossary](#glossary) section of this post. As I have mentioned elsewhere on this blog I have tried quite a few LDs and I have also tried quite a few different DEs/WMs, but because of my own technical limitations only a small handful of them I have used enough to confidently review. Notable DEs/WMs include:
* [**awesome**](#awesome) &mdash; a lightweight and extensively configurable, dynamic window manager that is best suited for advanced users.
* **Budgie Desktop** &mdash; a desktop environment used by Solus OS, which resembles the user interface of Chrome OS. It is built on a GNOME 3 base. This one is not covered in this post, because I find it a very boring desktop to be honest, it really is just a customized version of GNOME 3 that looks like Chrome OS. If you want to try it on Arch or Manjaro run:

* [**Cinnamon**](#cinnamon) &mdash; a GNOME 3 fork with a more traditional user interface that is developed for use as Linux Mint's default desktop.
* [**Deepin Desktop Environment**](#deepin-desktop-environment) (**DDE**) &mdash; a desktop environment developed for Deepin, a Debian and formerly Ubuntu-based Linux distribution originating from China.
* [**Enlightenment**](#enlightenment) &mdash; a feature-packed eye-candy stacking window manager originally developed in the mid 1990s. It is the most popular standalone window manager (not associated with any particular desktop environment) that has become Wayland-compatible.
* [**Fluxbox**](#fluxbox) &mdash; a lightweight and simple window manager.
* [**GNOME**](#gnome) &mdash; a DE that is developed as part of the GNU Project, it and KDE are two of the "main" Linux DEs. It is built using the GTK+ toolkit. It has Wayland compatibility.
* **Hawaii** &mdash; a Qt5, Qt Quick and Wayland based desktop environment that is still in beta development. It is so unstable that I am going to skip reviewing it.

* [**i3**](#i3) &mdash; a dynamic tiling WM that is oriented towards advanced users that is lightweight and extensively configurable.
* [**KDE**](#kde) &mdash; a DE based on the Qt widget toolkit that is extensively customizable and beginner-friendly. Its Wayland compatibility is still in its infancy.
* [**Lumina**](#lumina) &mdash; a DE originally developed for use by FreeBSD and its derivatives like PC-BSD. It is based on the Qt toolkit and Fluxbox window manager.
* [**LXDE**](#lxde) &mdash; a lightweight DE based on the GTK+2 toolkit with energy-saving features. An experimental GTK+3 based version is available on Arch Linux.
* [**LXQt**](#lxqt) &mdash; a lightweight DE based on the Qt toolkit, that was developed when the chief developer of LXDE frustrated with issues relating to the new GTK+3 toolkit, decided to switch the DE to Qt4 and then Qt5.
* [**MATE**](#mate) &mdash; a lightweight DE forked from GNOME 2. It was developed due to frustrations over the untraditional user interface of GNOME 3.
* [**Moksha**](#moksha) &mdash; an E17 fork used by the Ubuntu derivative, Bodhi Linux.
* [**Pantheon**](#pantheon) &mdash; the default desktop environment of elementary OS, written in Vala and uses the GTK+3 toolkit.
* [**Trinity Desktop Environment**](#trinity-desktop-environment) (**TDE**) &mdash; a KDE 3.5 fork maintained by a small team of developers.
* [**Unity**](#unity) &mdash; a desktop environment based on GNOME that is used by Ubuntu.
* [**Xfce**](#xfce) &mdash; a lightweight desktop environment based on GTK+.
