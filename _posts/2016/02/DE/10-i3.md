### Background
[**i3**](http://i3wm.org/) is a lightweight dynamic window manager that is primarily geared towards advanced and experienced users. Its configuration files are written in a JSON format. i3 configuration settings can be found in one of two user directories, `~/.config/i3` and `~/.i3`. I have limited experience with i3, so I cannot comment further on this, but I would recommend reading [*The ArchWiki* article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/i3) on this topic. I have limited experience with i3, but I understand it includes a panel and an in-built configuration wizard (`i3-config-wizard`).

### Components
* **Display server/window system**: X11.
* **File manager**: None.
* **Widget toolkit**: None.
* **Window manager**: i3.

### Obtaining It
i3 can be easily installed on most Linux distributions via their respective package managers. To do this run:
* {% include Search/debian.md package="i3" %}
* {% include Search/arch.md package="i3" %}
* {% include Search/ubuntu.md package="i3" %}
* {% include Search/gentoo.md package="x11-wm/i3" %}
* {% include Search/centos.md package="i3" %}
* {% include Search/fedora.md package="i3" %}
* {% include Search/mageia.md package="i3" %}
* {% include Search/opensuse.md package="i3" %}
* {% include Search/sabayon.md package="x11-wm/i3" %}

### Ratings
* **Availability**: 8. Available from package managers for most distributions, Mageia included.
* **Beginner-friendliness**: 4? This rating is very questionable in its accuracy, as I have hardly ever used i3. i3 has a reputation for being geared towards more advanced users, so based on this I am providing this rating.
* **Customizability**: 8? From what I understand it is a very customizable WM, for advanced users.
* **Features**: 8?
* <abbr title="My Experience With It">**MEWI**</abbr>: 1.
* **Stability**: 8? In my limited experience it seems stable.
* **Support**: 7-8. Support seems fairly good, like its docs.
* **System resource usage**: 8. I could not assess the RAM usage of i3 using `ps_mem` on an Arch VM due to PGP corruption errors with the i3 core packages.
* **Overall**: 8.
