      As you can see most Linux-compatible text editors will also run on Windows and while the reverse is mostly true there are exceptions. Atom is my favourite text editor, as it is extensively customizable, yet free and simple enough for my grandmother, who I think has probably never even used a computer, to use. Atom is fairly heavy, in terms of its memory footprint (heavier than all other text editors mentioned in this table, actually), download and installed size (~50-60 MB and ~200-250 MB, respectively) and its startup time.<br/><br/>

      GNU Emacs and gVim/Vim are the most popular text editors amongst seasoned programmers, however. GNU Emacs is the most customizable and extensible, thanks to the Emacs Lisp programming language, while Vim is more portable, uses less RAM and CPU, is faster and, for those with enough experience with it, it may have productivity advantages over GNU Emacs, as it relies less on a mouse and keyboard-shortcuts than GNU Emacs. Vim's programming language, VimL (or Vim script), is simpler and easier to learn, IMO, than Emacs Lisp and Vim also has better package management, IMO, than GNU Emacs.<a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote">↩</a>
