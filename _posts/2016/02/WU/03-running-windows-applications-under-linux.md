## Running Windows Apps
As previously mentioned emulation software can be used to run Windows applications under Linux. The most popular free and open-source examples of such software are VirtualBox and Wine. Both of which are available from the software repositories of most Linux distributions.

**VirtualBox** can be used to run Windows applications, if and only if you have the installation media (like a live CD/DVD) and the product key required for the Windows system you need to run the application under. This installation media costs money, however, so beware. Plus running Windows applications under VirtualBox means that your program will have less CPU processing power and RAM available for it to use. See your Windows Virtual Machine (VM) will be able to use at most one-third of your computer's total RAM, and one-forth of your processor cores (e.g., my Lenovo Laptop has four cores, so I can only give my VMs one core to use). VirtualBox VMs also take a fair amount of hard disk drive space too.

**Wine** can be used to run some Windows applications, but not all. To see a list of applications known to run flawlessly under Wine see [here](https://appdb.winehq.org/). If the Windows application you wish to run takes a lot of CPU or RAM, than I would not hold your breath that it will run natively under Wine though, most Wine-compatible applications are fairly lightweight.
