## Summary
If you want a Linux distribution, that gives you as much a "free-ride", that is, it holds your hand through as much of the journey, as possible, then I would recommend using one of the following three distributions:

* Linux Mint. This one has the most Windows-like look to it, although if you have a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip you may need some help setting your Wi-Fi up.
* Manjaro Linux. This one is the most "out-of-the-box" of these three. Although, some software you may want (e.g., Spotify) must be installed from the command-line, which can be intimidating for Windows users. It is best for those that dislike performing distribution upgrades, like myself.
* Ubuntu. This one has the best community support, in-my-opinion, and is (arguably) the most stable of the three.

Ubuntu (specifically the Lubuntu spin) is probably the best for older computers.
