[Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) (1, 2, 4, 6), a distribution that is well-known for its beginner-friendliness. It is developed by a Linux company called Canonical Ltd. Its software is usually more out-of-date than all other distributions mentioned in this post, except for openSUSE Leap. It has got the best support community, in terms of response times, in my opinion. Specifically it has a StackExchange website called [AskUbuntu](http://askubuntu.com) that I find quite good. Its official repositories contain mostly FOSS, along with some proprietary drivers. Several unofficial Personal Package Repositories (PPAs) exist, however, although I am yet to find one containing Spotify, probably because a Spotify repository is provided and maintained Spotify AB (the company that develops Spotify), to find details go [here](https://www.spotify.com/uk/download/). Its main support IRC channel is [#ubuntu](irc://irc.freenode.net/ubuntu).
