## Which PC should I run Linux on?
Linux has different hardware requirements than Windows, although most Windows or even OS X-compatible PCs should be able to run Linux. Linux (specifically the Debian and Gentoo Linux distributions that are usually not the most newcomer-friendly) can run on virtually any computer, even those that are incompatible with Windows or OS X. This is because it supports a larger variety of different CPUs than these two proprietary operating systems. Linux can even run on older computers that do not meet the CPU or RAM requirements of the latest releases of Windows or OS X. The only problem is that some pieces of hardware like a laptop's Wi-Fi chip may be incompatible with Linux, but compatible with Windows or OS X. This is because by-and-large Linux is less compatible with proprietary software than these two proprietary operating systems, and this includes the firmware required to use these chips.

Both of the laptops I use on a regular basis use Broadcom Wi-Fi chips. My newest laptop uses a chip that is incompatible with Linux (I cannot remember the specific make though), so until that is rectified I have it running Windows, and my other laptop uses a BCM43228 chip which is compatible with Linux, but requires some proprietary firmware that is not in the repository of most distributions I have used. The only exceptions are Manjaro and Sabayon Linux.
