## Which PC?
Which computer should you run Linux on? Well the answer is not clear-cut, virtually any computer *can* run Linux (several computers that are not even compatible with Windows or OS X can even run Linux), but some computers will have some devices that are off-limits to Linux. See one area in which Linux really lags behind the two more popular operating systems, Windows and OS X, is the availability of compatible device drivers. **Device drivers** (or just **drivers**) are computer programs that operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Many devices require proprietary drivers. Example devices that sometimes require, or work better with, proprietary device drivers include some graphics cards and Wi-Fi chips. My Lenovo Laptop has a Broadcom BCM43228 Wi-Fi chip (which I, of course, use to connect to my Wi-Fi), which requires a proprietary driver usually referred to on Linux platforms as `broadcom-wl`, while my graphics cards (one is Intel, the other is NVIDIA) both have free and open-source device drivers available. Hence the only one of these that causes me much grief when I install a new distro is my BCM43228 chip.

Linux is so flexible in the variety of computers it can run on because it supports a larger variety of different CPU types (or architectures) than Windows or OS X. Linux can even run on older computers that do not meet the CPU or RAM requirements of the latest releases of Windows or OS X.
