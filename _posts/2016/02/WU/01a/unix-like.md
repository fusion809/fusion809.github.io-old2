Linux is [**Unix-like**](/glossary/#unix-like), Windows is not. Windows systems do not follow the Unix design philosophy and as such have fundamental differences from corresponding Linux systems. These differences are most evident by examining the file system structure of Windows and comparing it to that of Unix-like systems such as Linux. Windows uses single-letter, with a colon afterward, prefixes to distinguish between hard disks. `C:` is used for the hard drive on which the presently-running Windows system is booting from. Folders in Windows are denoted using back-slashes `\`, for example, a user named Brenton's home directory may be located at `C:\Users\Brenton`. Linux's file system, on the other hand, does not use any suffixes and rather uses forward-slashes to denote directories. For example, a user named Brenton would have a home directory at `/home/Brenton`. Unix also has its own set of command-line utilities and an interpreter called an Unix shell.
