A **variety** of **desktop environments** (**DEs**) to choose from. On Windows systems you are stuck with one desktop or graphical user interface (which looks a little different between Windows versions), your customization options beyond changing your wallpaper and theme, are fairly limited, unless you use some DLL hacks which can be damaging to your system. Linux systems have a variety of different desktop environments available, each can be customized according to your own preferences, without damaging your system. The most popular Linux desktop environments, include: Cinnamon, Enlightenment, GNOME, KDE, LXDE, LXQt, MATE and Xfce. Of these Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE and Xfce look the most like Windows NT. KDE and Xfce are the most popular of these DEs, while LXDE and Xfce uses up the least CPU and RAM of these. If you would like to have an OS X-like look to your Linux system I suggest using the less popular Deepin or Pantheon desktop environments, which are the default on the deepin and elementary OS distros.
