**Linux is [Unix-like](/glossary/#unix-like), Windows is not**. Windows systems do not follow the Unix design philosophy and as such have fundamental differences from corresponding &#42;nix systems such as Linux. These differences are most evident by examining the file system structure of Windows and comparing it to that of Unix-like systems such as Linux. Windows uses single-letter, with a colon afterward, prefixes to distinguish between hard disks. `C:` is used for the hard drive on which the presently-running Windows system is booting from. Folders in Windows are denoted using back-slashes `\`, for example, a user named Brenton's home directory may be located at `C:\Users\Brenton`. Linux's file system, on the other hand, does not use any prefixes and rather uses forward-slashes to denote directories. For example, a user named Brenton would have a home directory at `/home/Brenton`. Unix also has its own set of command-line utilities (which vary from operating system to operating system; Linux distributions by-in-large use GNU command-line utilities) and an interpreter called an Unix shell (which also varies according to one's Unix system; the default on most Linux distributions is Bash, although I feel more comfortable using Zsh, myself).
