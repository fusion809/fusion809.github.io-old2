**How software is installed**. Windows software is usually installed via downloading, double-clicking and going through their automated installer of files with the `.exe` or `.msi` file extensions. Installing Linux software is usually a little different and most software is installed via the specific distribution's package manager. For some distributions, it may be possible to install applications via downloading (e.g., in a web browser) a software package (with a file extension that is dependent on the specific distribution in question), double-clicking it and going through the graphical package manager of the distribution.
