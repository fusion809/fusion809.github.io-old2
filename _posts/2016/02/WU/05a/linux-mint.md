[Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com/) (1-6), a Ubuntu-based distribution developed by a community of unpaid volunteers. It is built on the Long-Term Support (LTS) releases of Ubuntu which come out in April of even-numbered years (e.g., the last one was in April 2014) and are designed to be especially stable, although their software tends to lag behind that of newer Ubuntu releases. Its chief advantage, in my opinion, over Ubuntu is that it has better out-of-the-box support for several proprietary multimedia codecs (codecs are programs required to play certain multimedia files) and graphics drivers. It does **not** have out-of-the-box support for Broadcom chips with proprietary firmware like mine. I have not used its community support, personally, so I cannot comment on its quality. It has a Windows-like look, though, with a task bar (or panel) across the bottom of the screen. If you need free support with Linux Mint I would recommend using their [forums](https://forums.linuxmint.com/) or IRC channel {% include Links/irc.html channel="linuxmint-help" puncl="(" puncr=")." %}
