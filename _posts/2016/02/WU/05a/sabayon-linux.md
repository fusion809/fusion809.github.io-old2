#### Sabayon Linux
[Sabayon Linux](http://sabayon.org/) (1-5), a distribution with similarly extensive, out-of-the-box support to Manjaro. Like Manjaro, however, it is also based on a non-beginner-friendly distro, except in Sabayon's case this distro is Gentoo Linux and not Arch Linux. Most of Sabayon's software is as up-to-date as the corresponding Manjaro software, although some programs may lag behind. Its chief disadvantage is its small online support community, which I have found can be a little more testy than that of openSUSE. Its official software repositories contain some freeware packages like Spotify too.

Its official repositories (that is, the ones you can access and install packages from using its main package manager, Entropy) may be missing some packages you would like to use, most of these packages you can get via more challenging methods (most notably by using Gentoo's package manager, Portage, which also comes pre-installed on Sabayon), which for the most part have to be done from the command-line. For example, when I first started using this distribution, I wanted to install SageMath, a mathematics program not in the official Entropy repositories, to do this I needed to use Portage and the [`sage-on-gentoo`](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo) overlay (which is an unofficial Gentoo repository). Its forums are [here](https://forum.sabayon.org/) and its main support IRC channel is [here](irc://irc.freenode.net/sabayon).
