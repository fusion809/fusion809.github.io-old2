      <td class="green">Deluge, KTorrent, qBittorrent, Vuze.</td>
      <td class="green">qBittorrent will likely be the most intuitive to &#956;Torrent users. A browser-based version of &#956;Torrent is available in Debian-based distros like Ubuntu, but I would not recommend it personally as it can be more trouble than it is worth.</td>

      <td class="green">Adobe Acrobat, Atril, Evince, MuPDF, Okular.</td>
      <td class="green">Okular in my opinion, is the best FOSS document viewer as it is compatible with the greatest number of document formats.</td>

      <td class="green">KMail is the default KDE Mail Client, while Thunderbird is developed by the <i>Mozilla Foundation</i>, the same foundation that provides the Firefox web browser. You can use Thunderbird on Windows, but it is not particularly popular on Windows.</td>

      <td class="green">SMPlayer and VLC are the most feature-packed (including the greatest support for a variety of media files) of these, in my experience. VLC can be buggy on Gentoo and Sabayon, however, in my experience.</td>
