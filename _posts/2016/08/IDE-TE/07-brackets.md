**Brackets** is a text editor developed by Adobe Systems that is primarily intended for web development. It is built on the Electron framework and written in web languages.

{% include Layouts/clear.html %}<br/>

### Customizability
It is extensible via plugins, although I have limited experience with Brackets (as I am not much of a web developer).

### Features
It is designed to be used for web development, so its features are mostly web-oriented. I have limited experience with it, however, so I cannot really comment on the extent of these features.

### Obtaining It
It is in the official repositories of no Linux distributions I am aware of. Official Debian binary releases are available from the [Bracket's release notes](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/releases) page at GitHub. Unofficial RPM builds are available from the [Mosquito Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mosquito/brackets/). There is also an [AppImage build](https://bintray.com/probono/AppImages/Brackets#files) of it, which can be used to run Brackets, without installing it, on a variety of other Linux distributions.

### Advantages
* Fairly easy to obtain on Linux thanks to its AppImage build.

### Disadvantages
* Buggy. I personally have found it more buggy than other IDEs/text editors built on the Electron framework I have experience with.
