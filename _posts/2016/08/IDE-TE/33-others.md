## Limitations
This comparison of IDEs and text editors is far from comprehensive, there are several others I am aware of, that I have not included for a variety of different reasons. This comparison is not perfect, as I know to do anything near a perfect comparison I would have to compare each individual IDE/TE in great detail, with specific reference to their individual supported programming languages and how well they support each individual language. This is not done, deliberately, as it would take too long and I am simply not familiar enough with each editor to do this.

There are two text editors/IDEs that I know can run quite well on Linux through Wine:

* [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

They are excluded from this comparison because they do not run *natively* on Linux, rather they are Windows applications that must be run through Wine. Of note, however, I have found that SharpDevelop and Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 cannot be run through Wine.

Likewise there are some obscure text editors like Kilo and X2 that have been deliberately excluded from this comparison as they are not well-known and including each obscure text editor available would take too much time. Plus I have deliberately excluded IDEs that are designed for one specific purpose, such as:

* Anjuta (designed for building GNOME apps)
* GNOME Builder (designed for GNOME app building)
* GNU Octave (designed for numerical analysis)
* MATLAB (designed for technical computing)
* Scilab (designed for scientific computing)
* Spyder (designed for numerical analysis)
