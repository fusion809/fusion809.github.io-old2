### Background
{% include Infoboxes/editor.html editor="Code::Blocks" language="C++." developers="The Code::Blocks team." date="2005." license="GPLv3." focus="C/C++ IDE." %}
[**Code::Blocks**](http://www.codeblocks.org/) is a free and open-source cross-platform IDE for C, C++ and Fortran, that is written predominantly in C++ and to a lesser extent C. Its GUI is based on the wxWidgets toolkit. It is compatible with a wide range of different compilers, including GCC, Clang and Visual C++. Its development began ca. 2004.[^2]

### Customizability
It is extensible through plugins[^3], although I have limited experience with this program so I cannot really comment any further on this.

### Features
It provides many of the advanced features of text editors like syntax highlighting, code folding, code completion, *etc.* for C, C++, Fortran and XML files.

### Obtaining It
It is found in the official repositories of most distributions. The only notable exception is Debian (stable)'s official repositories, which lacks Code::Blocks, although the testing and unstable branches do have Code::Blocks builds.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Cross-platform and able to run on Windows, OS X and Linux.
* Fairly lightweight.
* Feature-packed.
* Has code linting for its three supported languages.
* Easy to install on both distributions.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Only supports three programming languages: C, C++ and Fortran.
* Fairly infrequently updated. New releases come out once every few years.
