### Background
{% include Infoboxes/editor.html editor="CodeLite" repo="eranif/codelite" focus="C/C++/PHP/Node.js IDE." logo="codelite.png" language="C++." developers="Eran Ifrah." license="<a href='https://github.com/eranif/codelite/blob/master/LICENSE' link='_blank'>GPLv2</a>" %}
[**CodeLite**](http://codelite.org/) is a lightweight IDE for C, C++, PHP and Node.js that is written in C and C++. It does not support any other programming languages, besides these four. I personally have found it a nuisance to use, as its interface does not include a button to click in order to compile and/or run your C/C++ program. Plus I have found it a challenge to figure out how to build a program in it anyway.

### Customizability
I have limited experience with CodeLite, so I cannot really comment with confidence on its customizability, but from what I understand it is designed to be lightweight and their website does not really mention any plugins or other customizations.

### Features
It is fairly feature-packed (including git, subversion, GUI-building, *etc.* support) for the programming languages it supports.

### Obtaining It
CodeLite is in the official repositories of some distributions. Although it can be found in the unofficial repositories of some distributions. Distribution's who's official repositories do not contain it:

* Arch Linux
* Fedora
* Gentoo Linux
* Mageia
* Manjaro Linux

While:

* Debian (6.1.1 &mdash; stable; 9.2 &mdash; unstable)
* openSUSE (8.1)
* Sabayon (4.1.5770)
* Ubuntu (9.1)

have CodeLite in their official repositories, but fairly outdated versions as of 29 August 2016 (with the precise latest available version listed in brackets after their name).

### Advantages (Pros)
* Cross-platform able to run on Windows, OS X and Linux.
* Fairly lightweight for an IDE.
* Feature-packed.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Support for only four programming languages.
* Not in the official binary package repositories for either Manjaro or Sabayon.
