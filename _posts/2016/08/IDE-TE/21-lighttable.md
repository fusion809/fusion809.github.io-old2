### Background
{% include Infoboxes/editor.html editor="LightTable" date="April 2012." language="ClojureScript." repo="LightTable/LightTable" license="<a href='https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/blob/master/LICENSE.md' link='_blank'>MIT</a>." developers="<a href='https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/graphs/contributors' link='_blank'>LightTable Development Team</a>." logo="lighttable.png" focus="Web development IDE." %}
**LightTable** is a open-source IDE that is oriented towards web development. It is built on the Electron framework, and written in ClojureScript.

{% include Layouts/clear.html %}<br/>

### Customizability
It is extended via a plugin system.

### Features
As it is oriented towards web development it has many of the features you would expect of such an IDE, such as a live preview of websites you are developing. It also has syntax-highlighting and the usual set of text editor features for its supported programming languages.

### Obtaining It
It is not in the official repositories of any Linux distribution I am aware of, but a binary tarball release is available from its [releases GitHub page](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/releases). It has a free AppImage available for 64-bit Linux platforms [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3fbofqvkn8ex55q/LightTable-0.8.1_x64.AppImage.tar.gz?dl=0).

### Advantages
* Fairly feature-packed, keeping in mind its being limited, in its intended use, to web development.
* Easy to obtain on most Linux distributions thanks to its AppImage.

### Disadvantages
* Requires fairly out-of-date libraries to run, if installed the old-fashion way using a package manager.
* Has a limited set of intended uses.
