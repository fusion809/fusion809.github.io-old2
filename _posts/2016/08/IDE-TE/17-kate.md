[**Kate**](http://kate-editor.org) which is abbreviated from <b>K</b>DE <b>A</b>dvanced <b>T</b>ext <b>E</b>ditor, is a text editor that is a KDE Core Application (a part of the KDE Software Compilation or KDE SC) and combines features of an advanced text editor (that is, one geared towards software developers and experienced programmers) such as customizability, extensive syntax-highlighting, code-indentation, *etc.* support with sufficient user-friendliness for it to be suitable for inexperienced Linux users. Its development began in 2001 and has been a central part of KDE SC ever since.

[**KWrite**](https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository) as I understand it (but I must admit I am a little confused by the degree of overlap between Kate and KWrite) is designed to be a lightweight derivative of Kate.

### Customizability
Some customization (such as of keyboard shortcuts, the toolbar and a few other features) can be done graphically via going to the "Settings" menu and selecting an option from the menu. From what I can gather, however, limited customization can be done textually via user-supplied scripts.

### Features
It has syntax-highlighting and auto-indentation support for over 180 different computer languages, including MediaWiki and shell script, but excluding PyMOL. It also has embedded terminal support.

### Obtaining It
Kate and KWrite are found in the official repositories of most distributions &mdash; if the distribution has the KDE desktop environment (regardless of whether they are still packing KDE Plasma 4 or whether they have updated to Plasma 5), then Kate and KWrite should be available from their official repositories.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Easily customizable via graphical tools.
* Intuitive keyboard shortcuts by default.
* Extensive support for a wide range of computer languages.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Minimal customization can be made to Kate/KWrite, via user-supplied scripts.
* Due to it being part of KDE SC it cannot be too easily ported to Microsoft Windows or OS X, although it is readily available on most Linux distributions.
