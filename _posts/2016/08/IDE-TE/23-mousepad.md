[**Mousepad**](http://git.xfce.org/apps/mousepad/) is a core application of the Xfce desktop environment, that was originally forked from Leafpad. Like Leafpad it is fairly lightweight, but unlike Leafpad, Mousepad can be customized and has a few basic features that are absent from Leafpad, such as syntax highlighting support for a few computer languages.

### Customizability
Some basic customization can be done, graphically, by going to Edit‚ÜêPreferences in the toolbar. Some customization of its appearance can be done by going to the View menu. Beyond this, to my knowledge, it cannot be customized.

### Features
It supports syntax-highlighting for roughly, a couple of dozen computer languages.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Lightweight.
* All customization can be done graphically.
* User-friendly.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Basic, limited computer language support.
* Limited customization options.
