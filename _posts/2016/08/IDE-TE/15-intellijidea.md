[**IntelliJ IDEA CE**](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), which I will abbreviate as **IJCE**, is a free and open-source IDE developed by JetBrains that is designed specifically for Java development. It is the free counterpart to a proprietary IDE (called IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition) that is more feature-packed with support for several additional programming languages, including Python. Its support for programming languages is extended by use of plugins &mdash; the ultimate edition can even get a Python plugin that will provide it with all the features of PyCharm Professional Edition, which is also developed by JetBrains.

### Customizability
IntelliJ IDEA's customizability is something I really cannot comment on, but I would imagine it is not very customizable due to the fact that this would defeat the purpose of JetBeans creating a community edition, which is to tempt users to buy the proprietary, Ultimate Edition, with the extra features it has as opposed to the community edition.

### Features
Its features is something I cannot really comment on as I have limited experience with it, but it does not support any programming languages beyond a limited set including and related to Java like the Groovy programming language.

### Obtaining It
IntelliJ IDEA CE is not in the official repositories of many Linux distributions, although binary tarballs for it are available that can be used to run IntelliJ IDEA CE without installing it. An [AppImage](https://bintray.com/probono/AppImages/IDEA) for it exists.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Easy to install on any Linux platform.
* Cross-platform.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Cannot be installed via the usual methods on most distributions.
* Limited set of features and supported languages.
