[**Bluefish**](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html) is a text editor, primarily intended for web development and programming, as it provides syntax highlighting support and other features mostly for web markup, programming and style sheet languages.

### Customizability
I have limited experience with Bluefish but from what I can gather, it is customizable, although I cannot comment on how extensive this customizability is.

### Features
Syntax highlighting is available for almost (if not all) all computer languages used in web development.

### Obtaining It
Bluefish is in the official repositories of most distributions.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Customizable.
* Has features that would appeal to a web developer.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Support for non-web markup/programming languages is less than adequate.
