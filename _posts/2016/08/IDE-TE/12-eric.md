[**Eric**](http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/) is a free and open-source IDE that is developed by its own community of donation-sponsored developers. It is written in and used to program in Python. As of Eric version 6, it supports both Python 2 and Python 3.

### Customizability
Eric has an extensive in-built plugin system. These plugins can be installed from within Eric's interface by going to "Plugins&rarr;Plugin Repository" and selecting the required plugin. I have limited experience with it so I cannot comment on its customizability.

### Features
Its features include support for managing Mercurial, Subversion and Git repositories, an integrated Python debugger, an interactive embedded Python shell with syntax-highlighting, syntax-highlighting for its text editor component, code autocompletion, *etc.*

### Obtaining It
Eric is found in the official repositories of most Linux distributions, including (but not limited to):

* Arch Linux
* Debian (unstable)
* Fedora

### Advantages (Pros)
