### Background
{% include Infoboxes/editor.html editor="Leafpad" language="C." developers="LXDE Development Team." focus="Simple text editor." license="GPLv2." %}
[**Leafpad**](http://tarot.freeshell.org/leafpad/) is a lightweight and basic GTK+ based text editor. Its capabilities (or rather lack thereof) are very similar to those of Windows' Notepad.

### Customizability
There is little, if any, customizability for Leafpad.

### Features
It offers no syntax highlighting support or auto-indentation support that I am aware of.

### Obtaining It
It is often included along with the LXDE core application suite, so it is available from the official repositories of the vast majority of Linux distributions.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Its chief advantage is its low system resource usage.
* Easy to install on most distributions.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* It is very basic, has minimal customizability or features.
