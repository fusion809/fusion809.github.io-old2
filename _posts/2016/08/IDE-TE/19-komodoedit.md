[**Komodo Edit**](http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/) is a free and open-source text editor developed by ActiveState that is based on the Mozilla Platform. ActiveState also develops a proprietary IDE based on Komodo Edit called [Komodo IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_IDE). It supports several popular computer languages, including: Bash, C, C++, C#, CoffeeScript, CSS, Go, HTML, JavaScript, Less, Markdown, Perl, PHP, Python, Python3, *etc.*

### Customizability
Komodo Edit can be customized and extended by use of packages that come in the `.xpi` file format (the same format used by Firefox extensions) and can be downloaded from http://komodoide.com/packages/. I have limited experience with Komodo Edit, so I do not know just how customizable it is by use of these extensions.

### Features
Komodo Edit can have extra features added to it by use of plugins.

### Obtaining It
It is not in the official repositories of any distribution I am aware of. Fortunately, binary tarball releases are available from the Komodo IDE website.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Seems fairly feature-packed, something tells me that its feature set is likely similar to Atom.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Komodo Edit is fairly heavy on SRU.
* It is not in the official repositories of any distribution I am aware of.
