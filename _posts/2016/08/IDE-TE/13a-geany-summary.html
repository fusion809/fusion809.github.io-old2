<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 8. Most repositories have Geany in their official repositories</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: 8. It seems fairly user-friendly, as its keyboard shortcuts are fairly intuitive.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 7? My experience with this TE is too limited for me to be confident with this rating.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8.</li>
	<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 2. Fairly minimal, I have attempted to use it as a Python IDE, with limited success.</li>
	<li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 8. <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/geany,126394,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">Geany 1.24.1</a> is a 3.4 MB download and takes up 9.8 MB HDD space when installed. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table (remember I have neglected to include the RAM used by the embedded terminal emulator): {% include Code/gist.html id="9bf5b312368c9701e7a4" %} while under Manjaro Linux Geany 1.26.2 is a 2.9 MB download and takes up 10.9 MB when installed. Geany 1.26.2 also gave this <code>ps_mem</code> table under Manjaro: {% include Code/gist.html id="ea322f19dfbc2e1a984a" %}</li>
