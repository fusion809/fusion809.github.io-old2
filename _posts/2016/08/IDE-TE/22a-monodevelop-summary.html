<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 8. Easy to install on most distributions with one's package manager.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: ~7. Its keyboard shortcuts are intuitive (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy). I found it how it manages files in projects to be a little confusing. Beyond this my experience with it is not extensive enough for me to comment.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;7-8. It is customizable, but as I do not have much experience with this IDE, I do not know just how customizable it is.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;9. It is possible to do debugging in it and other nice features.</li>
	<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 2. I have used it a little here and there.</li>
	<li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 4-5. Here is my <code>ps_mem</code> table for MonoDevelop 5.10 on Ubuntu 16.04: <script src="https://gist.github.com/fusion809/bb0972cf9fe6ce40fd60338fe6e68647.js"></script>. It's a 7.8 MB download and takes up 31.6 MB when installed.</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8-9.</li>
