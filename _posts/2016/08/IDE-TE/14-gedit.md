### Background
{% include Infoboxes/editor.html editor="gedit" language="C, Python." repo="GNOME/gedit" license="<a href='https://github.com/GNOME/gedit/blob/master/COPYING' link='_blank'>GPLv2</a>." date="February 1999." developers="GNOME." logo="gedit.png" focus="General-purpose text editor." %}
[**gedit**](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) is a GTK+ based text editor that is one of the core applications of GNOME. In my opinion, it is the second most advanced text editor (after Kate) that is part of a desktop environment's core application suite. It is also more advanced than Windows' Notepad and Wordpad text editors. Despite this it is also beginner-friendly and uses a standard keymap.

### Customizability
gedit is able to be customized, although from what I have gathered from reading its Wiki, customization options are limited as it does not seem to support advanced customization (via editing configure files, for example), rather there are some themes and plugins available but the plugins seem fairly limited.

### Features
It supports syntax highlighting of several computer languages, including Desktop Configuration files (`.desktop` or `.directory`), MATLAB, MediaWiki, GNU Octave, Scilab and shell script, just to name a few I know are absent in a few basic text editors. Although it does not support syntax highlighting for PyMOL or SageMath, so I would not say its syntax highlighting is as extensive as Atom's or Vim's.

### Advantages (Pros)
* Light on resources usage.
* Intuitive to use.
* Easy to obtain on Linux.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Customization options, beyond with a limited set of available themes and plugins, are limited.
* Fairly light on features, beyond syntax highlighting.

### Obtaining It
The vast majority of Linux distributions have gedit in their official repositories. If the distribution has the GNOME desktop environment in their official repositories they should also have gedit as it is a core application for GNOME.
