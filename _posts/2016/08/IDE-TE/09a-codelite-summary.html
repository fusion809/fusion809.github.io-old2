<ul>
  <li><strong>Availability</strong>: 6. Not available in either distribution's official repositories, but can be installed via unofficial channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: 7.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &lt;5.</li>
  <li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;8.</li>
  <li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 3.</li>
  <li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 4. The source code tarball of CodeLite 9.0 is about 69.5 MiB in size and as neither of these distributions have any binary packages from which CodeLite 9.0 can be installed, I cannot really say its installed size on Sabayon, while on Manjaro its size is 38.5 MiB. My <code>ps_mem</code> table on Sabayon is: {% include Code/gist.html id="da4d22c58eb9f28645ff" %} while here is my <code>ps_mem</code> table on Manjaro: {% include Code/gist.html id="508664d07b434e74f7f4" %}</li>
  <li><strong>Overall</strong>: 7-8. The fact it only supports these four programming languages is a weakness in my books.</li>
