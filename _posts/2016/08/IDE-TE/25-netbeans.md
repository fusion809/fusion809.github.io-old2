### Background
{% include Infoboxes/editor.html editor="NetBeans" language="Java." focus="C/C++/HTML5/Java/PHP IDE." date="1996." country="Czech Republic." developers="Oracle Corporation." license="<a href='https://netbeans.org/cddl-gplv2.html' link='_blank'>CDDL/GPLv2</a>." logo="netbeans.png" %}
[**NetBeans**](https://netbeans.org/) is a cross-platform free and open-source IDE written in Java and developed by the Oracle Corporation. It started out as a student project called Xelfi, in the former Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) and was originally proprietary, but it has since been re-released under the <abbr title="Common Development and Distribution License">CDDL</abbr> and GNU GPLv2 licenses.[^5] While originally purely a Java IDE, it has since been re-developed into an IDE for C, C++, Java, PHP and HTML5. I have written one program in Java in it; for this purpose it seemed to be a reasonable IDE. I have attempted to work with C/C++ programs in it too, although on Arch Linux I found its project wizard froze on me when working with a C/C++ project.

### Customizability
NetBeans is extensible via plugins provided at its [website](http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/). I have little experience with it myself, but I suspect it is reasonably extensible, but not totally.

### Features
NetBeans has the usual features of IDEs, including those of TEs like syntax-highlighting, autocompletion and auto-indentation for its programming languages and the ability to compile programs written in it.

### Obtaining It
It is found in the official repositories of most distributions. Even for those distributions that it is not in the official repositories of, should not be too challenging to run NetBeans on as official binary tarballs are provided by the Oracle Corporation that funds NetBeans' development.

### Advantages (Pros)
* It is extensible.
* Cross-platform and is able to run on any Java-capable platform.
* Feature-packed.

### Disadvantages (Cons)
* Fairly heavy on system resources.
* Fairly limited set of supported languages.
* A little buggy for me at least, on Arch Linux.
