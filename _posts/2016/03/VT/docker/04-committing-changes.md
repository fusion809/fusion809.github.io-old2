Once you finished making all the changes you intend to make to the Docker container, for now, you can run:

{% include Code/codeu.html line1="docker commit $CONTAINER $NAME" %}

where `$CONTAINER` is the container ID again, and `$NAME` is the name you would like to give your Docker container for future reference.
