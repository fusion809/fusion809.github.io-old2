### Gentoo Packages
**Gentoo packages** (file extension: `.tbz2`) are bz2-compressed binary packages used by Gentoo Linux and its derivatives. They are produced and installed using the Portage package manager. Sabayon Linux's Entropy package manager uses a slightly different package format, generated from the corresponding Gentoo packages using Entropy.
