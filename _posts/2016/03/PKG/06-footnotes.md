## Footnotes
[^1]: Usually contained in an ebuild, PKGBUILD, rules or spec file, depending on the package being built.
[^2]: If you are wondering about which components of each package you need, I suggest you look up the corresponding Arch Linux package and find equivalent packages for your distribution. See I am using the dependencies for the `osc` package in the AUR and its OBS-specific dependencies (like `obs-build`) to base this list on.
