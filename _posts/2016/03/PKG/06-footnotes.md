## Footnotes
[^1]: Usually contained in an ebuild, PKGBUILD, rules or spec file, depending on the package being built.
[^2]: If you are wondering about which components of each package you need, I suggest you look up the corresponding Arch Linux package and find equivalent packages for your distribution. See I am using the dependencies for the `osc` package in the AUR and its OBS-specific dependencies (like `obs-build`) to base this list on.
[^3]: Keep in mind, however, that packages built for one distribution, should be compatible and able to be installed on most, if not all, distributions derived from said distribution. For example, Arch Linux packages should be compatible with the Arch Linux derivative, Manjaro Linux.
