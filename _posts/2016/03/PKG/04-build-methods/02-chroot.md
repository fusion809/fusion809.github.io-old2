### In a Chroot
Chroot (invoked by the [`chroot`](/man/chroot.1.html) command) is a Unix command that is used to change the apparent root for a given process and its children (that is, processes started by this "given process"). When one uses it to build packages one usually sets up directory, with in it, the file system structure of the operating system one is intending to build packages for. I have fairly limited experience building packages in chroots and this is mostly limited to building in Gentoo / Sabayon chroots. For Gentoo / Sabayon chroots I usually created a new directory `/root2` wherein I would create a file system that resembles a minimal (with only the bare essential programs pre-installed) installation of Gentoo / Sabayon.
