#### Creating Packages
{% include Layouts/notei.md note1="An excellent Open Build Service tutorial can be found [here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Tutorial) at the *openSUSE Wiki*. While this tutorial is hosted by the *openSUSE Wiki*, it should work regardless of your platform. I recommend you read it as this post section **is not** designed to replace it!" %}

Creating packages in the OBS, modifying their characteristics, *etc.* can be the done from either the command-line or from within a web browser (URL: https://build.opensuse.org). I would recommend you have access to both methods, as they both compliment each other, although you can use just one method all the way. Both require an Internet connection; the command-line means of accessing the OBS also requires you have `osc` installed, while the browser method merely requires that you have a functioning web browser available to you. I personally use both methods of accessing the OBS, with my preference for doing most OBS things being through the command-line.
