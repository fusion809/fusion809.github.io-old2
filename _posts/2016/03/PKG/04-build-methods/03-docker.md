### Docker
[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source virtualization program that is written in Go, that enables the automated deployment of software containers (which usually contain miniature operating systems) that can be used for a variety of different purposes. One such purpose is the building of software packages. Building packages using Docker is similar to building packages in a chroot, as it involves using the standard tools for building the package in question (e.g., `makepkg` for ALPs and `ebuild` for Gentoo / Sabayon packages), but it is done in a safer environment (in this case, a software container). This environment (which is called a **container** in the case of Docker) is designed so that any programs running inside it (including package-building commands) cannot access or modify anything outside the environment, including components of the host's file system.
