[**Atom**](https://atom.io) is a free and open-source<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> text editor built on web technologies and developed by GitHub.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Its development was started by GitHub founder, Chris Wanstrath ([@defunkt](http://github.com/defunkt)), in mid 2008, as a side-project. He envisioned a text editor that was extensively hackable, similarly to the existing text editors [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), yet beginner-friendly enough for a primary school<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> student to pick it up without a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Sort of like the love-child of GNU Emacs and Notepad. Its development was put on hold by Wanstrath in favour of focusing on his main project, GitHub, which had only been founded mere months earlier. Later Atom's development was picked back up, with its first public release being in 2014. Later in June 2015 its first stable release (Atom 1.0) was made.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>

Atom is built using [**Electron**](https://electron.atom.io),<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> a framework formerly known as **Atom Shell**, that is used to build cross-platform stand-alone applications based on web technologies. Electron's source code is partly borrowed from [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/), the open-source web browser, who's source code is used as a basis for the closed-source Google Chrome web browser. Atom is essentially like a web browser that has been modified to be used as a text editor. You can plainly see the similarities by pressing the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>, which will open the developer tools in both Atom and Google Chrome. Atom also uses the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) JavaScript runtime engine, this fact is especially important when one tries to build Atom from source code.

Despite being user-friendly, Atom does share quite a few similarities to GNU Emacs, namely that it is extended using packages and themes that are written in at least one of the same computer languages it itself is written in. For GNU Emacs this computer language is Emacs Lisp (or ELisp), while with Atom these languages are web languages including CoffeeScript, CSS, JavaScript and Less. Atom and GNU Emacs also share the common characteristic of being free and open-source, cross-platform and being rather heavy, in terms of their download/installed size, and having a fairly long start-up time, compared with other text editors like gedit or Vim.
