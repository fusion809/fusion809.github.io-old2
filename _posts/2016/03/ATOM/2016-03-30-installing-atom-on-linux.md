[**Atom**](https://atom.io) is a free and open-source[^1] text editor built on web technologies and developed by GitHub.[^2] Its development was started by GitHub founder, Chris Wanstrath ([@defunkt](http://github.com/defunkt)), in mid 2008, as a side-project. Its developed was put on hold by Wanstrath in favour of developing GitHub which had only been founded mere months earlier. Later its development was picked back up, with its first public release being in 2014. Later in June 2015 its first stable release (Atom 1.0) was made.[^3] Atom is built using [**Electron**](https://electron.atom.io), an application formerly known as **Atom shell**, that is a framework used to build cross-platform stand-alone applications using web technologies. Electron's source code is based on that of Chromium, the open-source web browser, who's source code is used as a basis for the closed-source Google Chrome web browser.
