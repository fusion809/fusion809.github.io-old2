## Installing Atom
Atom is nowhere near as straight-forward to install as GNU Emacs, Vim or any other major free and open-source text editors. The reasons are several fold. Firstly, the vast majority of Linux distributions so far do not have an Atom package in their official software repositories. This leaves users to either have to build an Atom package themselves or compile Atom from source code. Secondly, building Atom from source code is an error-prone process that requires Internet access (and I do not mean to just retrieve Atom's source code). Thirdly, building Atom requires a recent version of Node.js and npm. The Atom GitHub repository has a mechanism for automatically building 64-bit Debian and RPM packages for each Atom release, which allows Atom to be easily installed on platforms capable of installing these packages.
