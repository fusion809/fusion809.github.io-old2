This section is just a **brief overview of Atom**, its **in-built capabilities**, **keyboard shortcuts** and alike. Much of this information can be found by experimenting with the options in the toolbar. This section is split up by where each of these options can be found in the toolbar. It truly is brief, however, I do not mention all things you can do with these toolbar menus or keyboard shortcuts, rather just some of those that are more useful for programmers and blog writers.

The toolbar has the following **top-level menus**:

* **File** &mdash; which contains the basic, usually file-related, functions.
* **Edit** &mdash; which contains functions related to editing files (e.g., copy is in there) and one's preferences.
* **View** &mdash; mostly relates to one's view of the edit (obviously). You can use it to open up panes, toggle full screen, toggle soft wrap, open up the command pallette, *etc.*
* **Selection** &mdash; obviously relates to selections. This menu is not of particular interest to me.
* **Find** &mdash; tools for finding and replacing characters in a buffer or project.
* **Packages** &mdash; tools that are from installed packages, including some bundled packages.
* **Help** &mdash; mostly relates to opening up Atom's documentation, license, terms of use, issues, *etc.*

### File
To **save a file** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>, while to **save a file under a different file name** (that is, "Save As...") press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.

### Edit
To **undo** and **redo** actions press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>, respectively. To open the `Settings` buffer go to <code>Edit&rarr;Preferences</code> in the toolbar. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> **copies selected text** to one's clipboard while to **copy files in the tree view** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

### View
To **Toggle Full Screen** press <kbd>F11</kbd>. To **reload your current Atom window** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, this will cause all changes that should happen when you close and reopen Atom. To **Toggle Tree View** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (that is, the file tree shown in the diagram above). To **toggle the command palette** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>. To **split your current pane upwards** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd>. To **split your current pane downwards** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>+<kbd>&darr;</kbd>. To **split your current pane left-wards** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd>. To **split your current pane right-wards** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd>.

### Find
To toggle the **find and replace buffer** press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>. To **hide this buffer**, to my knowledge there is no keyboard shortcut rather you have to go to <code>Find&rarr;Toggle Find in Buffer</code>.
