### BSD Ports System
On BSD derivatives, especially FreeBSD, a common form of package management is the so called "Ports" system. These ports are a series of subdirectories in the `/usr/ports` folder, each containing the source code of available packages that can be installed via this ports system. To install a package the user merely changes into the port of the package they want (this must be done as root, by-the-way, otherwise permission issues will be encountered later on in this process), configures the source code so that the package will be built with the features they want, and runs `make install`. The `/usr/ports` folder has a characteristic directory hierarchy inside it. See each individual package's build directory (which contains the source code) is found at <code>/usr/ports/<i>CAT</i>/<i>PACKAGE</i></code>, where <code><i>CAT</i></code> refers to the category the package belongs to (e.g., `www` for the Firefox web browser) and <code><i>PACKAGE</i></code> refers to the package's name (in the example of Firefox this would be simply `firefox`).

### Creating a Live Medium
In order to install any of the distributions mentioned in this post on a physical machine (as opposed to a virtual machine like through VirtualBox) you need to first create a live medium (which is either a CD, DVD or USB) from the ISO image (with the file extension `.iso`) provided by the distribution. Several more user-friendly distributions have their own set of tools for creating a live medium from such an ISO, the most popular tools that work with a variety of different distributions are the graphical [UNetBootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) program which is designed specifically for creating live USBs for Linux (I would only recommend using it, if you are uncomfortable with the command-line, as in my experience it is not unusual for it to create unusable live USBs) and the textual `dd` Unix command. To create one using the `dd` command, run the following (from the command-line of any &#42;nix system or Cygwin on Windows):
{% include Code/coder.html line1="dd bs=4M if=<i>/path/to/media.iso</i> of=/dev/sd<i>x</i> status=progress && sync" %}
where what is *italicized*, needs to be substituted with the corresponding values for the situation at hand. For example, I keep my live ISOs in my `/home/fusion809/VirtualBox VMs/ISOs` folder, so if I wanted to create a live USB for an ISO file `/home/fusion809/VirtualBox VMs/ISOs/archlinux.iso`, with my live USB being at `/dev/sdb` on my file system, then I would run (note the use of quotation marks around the ISO file's location, due to the appearance of spaces in the file's location, which makes quotation marks necessary. While their use around `/dev/sdb` is strictly not necessary, it is good practise):
{% include Code/coder.html line1="dd bs=4M if=&quot;/home/fusion809/VirtualBox VMs/ISOs/archlinux.iso&quot; of=&quot;/dev/sdb&quot; status=progress && sync" %}
For a guide on creating live USBs I would recommend the [ArchWiki article on this topic](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media), although keep in mind this guide is primarily written with creating a live USB for Arch Linux in mind and hence some methods described in it may not be applicable to all Linux distributions.

### Long-Term Support (LTS)
**Long-term support** (**LTS**), refers to software releases that have a longer than normal support lifetime (that is, the time period over which the program is still supported by its developer). Examples include Ubuntu (LTS) releases and Linux kernel (LTS) releases, which are supported for longer periods of time than standard releases.
