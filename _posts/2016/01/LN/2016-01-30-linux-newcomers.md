## Conclusion
As mentioned at the start of this post, if you are unsure as to which Linux distribution you should start off with, I would suggest you install each distribution you think might be best for you, on a VirtualBox VM and test them out. If you are looking for a distribution to replace Windows, and you want as little hassle (like dealing with bugs and lengthy and difficult installation processes for the system and for new packages on said system) as possible I would suggest you use CentOS, Debian, openSUSE (standard, not Tumbleweed edition) or Ubuntu. openSUSE and Ubuntu are probably best if you need some hand-holding through the transition from Linux to Windows. If you are intending to install Linux on a laptop which uses Wi-Fi for its Internet connection, then I would strongly recommend you use Ubuntu or one of its derivatives like Linux Mint, as openSUSE may (although it does depend on the specifics of your laptop) have difficulty connecting to your Wi-Fi.
