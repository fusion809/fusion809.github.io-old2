### Ratings
* **Beginner-friendliness**: ≤3.
* **Customizability**: ≥9.
* **Documentation**: ≥8. Some of the best documentation around, most of which is present at the Gentoo Wiki, while more complicated developer-type documentation (like writing ebuilds) can be found [here](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/). Most Gentoo ebuilds for complex programs (that actually need documentation, as they are not self-explanatory) also have USE flags that can be used to build documentation for the program.
* **Free support**: ? Only used the support forums for Gentoo {% include Links/link.html url="https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1030778.html" link="once" %} and I was asking for support with using Portage on Sabayon. This one time it was not particularly helpful. I have also used the IRC channel {% include Links/irc.html channel="gentoo-dev-help" %} twice for help writing some ebuilds and both times they were very helpful with the problem being solved within an hour of asking there.
* **Out-of-the-box**: 1. It is not out-of-the-box, the user has to do just about everything for themselves.
* **Package management**: &lt;8. I like Portage on ideological grounds, but on practical grounds it is virtually impossible to use, effectively, long-term, due to the upgrade issue I mentioned under Package Management.
* **Performance/<abbr title="System Resource Usage">SRU</abbr>**: 8. Low system resource requirements, true, but high CPU/RAM use when Portage is run.
* **Stability**: ~7-10. Due to the level of freedom users have when it comes to Gentoo, it is possible for them to choose older, yet more stable versions of each system software component, hence providing them a very stable system. Alternatively, if they prefer bleeding-edge software they can choose less, but more up-to-date versions of all one's system software.
* **<abbr title="My Experience With It (MEWI), a numerical estimate as to how much experience I have with this system">MEWI</abbr>**: ≤4. Given up due to the <code>emup</code> issues I mentioned.
* **Overall**: ≤6. Ideologically I love Gentoo, but as I said Portage can be a nightmare.
