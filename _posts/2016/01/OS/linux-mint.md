### Background
{% include_relative os.md os="Linux Mint" url="http://linuxmint.com" forum="http://linuxmint.com/forum/" docs="http://community.linuxmint.com/" bugs="https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxmint" gr="linuxmint" dw="mint" d="http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php" irc="http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/12" ml="http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=152&t=73603" %} is an Irish Linux distribution based on Ubuntu's LTS releases. What distinguishes it from the Ubuntu LTS releases it is built on is that it has browser plugins, media codecs, support for DVD playback and other pre-installed packages that are designed to make it more out-of-the-box. Linux Mint also has its own customized desktop built from GNOME 3 called [Cinnamon](http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/) (which has been ported to most major Linux distributions) and its own graphical package installer, MintInstall. As it is built on Ubuntu's LTS releases it is also compatible with Ubuntu's software repositories and can use them without a problem, usually, at least. Unfortunately LTS releases of Ubuntu usually ship with fairly old desktop/system software.

It is presently ranked first in terms of popularity, according to the *DistroWatch* website.

### Installer
Linux Mint uses the Ubiquity installer of Ubuntu.

### Package Management

MintInstall is essentially a Linux Mint equivalent to the Ubuntu Software Center as just like the software centre it is a graphical front-end for APT. I personally have fairly limited experience with it, so it may have a few features that the software centre lacks that I am unaware of.
