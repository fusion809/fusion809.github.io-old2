### Background
{% include_relative os.md ask="https://ask.fedoraproject.org/" bugs="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/" wiki="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Project_Wiki" ml="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help#Mailing_Lists" irc="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicating_and_getting_help#IRC_for_interactive_community_support" forum="http://fedoraforum.org/" wp="Fedora (operating system)" os="Fedora" docs="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/index.html" dw="fedora" d="https://torrent.fedoraproject.org/" url="http://getfedora.org/" %}, previously known as **Fedora Core** is a Linux distribution that was first founded in 2003 as a free continuation of the proprietary Red Hat Linux (RHL) distribution. It is developed by the Fedora Project, which is funded by Red Hat. Fedora, like its parent, uses RPM packages and originally used yum as its default package manager, until the release of Fedora 22 (F22) in May 2015 when it was replaced with a libsolv-based rewrite of yum called [**DNF**](http://dnf.baseurl.org/). Fedora's chief distinguishing characteristic, in my books, is that despite the fact it follows a fixed (or standard) release model, with new releases every 6-12 months, its system and desktop software is nearly always the latest stable versions available. For example, Fedora 23 (F23) ships with the 4.2 release of the Linux kernel and the 3.18 release of the GNOME desktop. Most Linux distributions that follow a fixed release model use the long-term stable (LTS) releases of the Linux kernel and other system software, for example, openSUSE 42.1 (released within a week of Fedora 23) shipped with the 4.1 kernel, because it is the latest LTS kernel available. Fedora is also the Linux distribution that is used by Linus Torvalds &mdash; the original developer of the Linux kernel.

The Fedora Project has more strict licensing requirements on its packages, than those imposed by Canonical on Ubuntu's packages. Due to this restriction, users that wish to install proprietary software (like drivers for their respective hardware) are left with fewer options, the most attractive of these options, in my opinion, is to add the RPM Fusion repositories to their Fedora machine. For instructions on how to do this see [this article](http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration).

I personally find it a distribution that is somewhere between Ubuntu and Arch Linux, in terms of difficulty of use, with respect to most things anyway. See like Ubuntu and unlike Arch Linux it has several different editions with a preinstalled desktop environment and additional out-of-the-box support. It also has an official graphical package management system (**PackageKit**) and a command-line package management system (DNF), which contributes to it being more user-friendly than Arch Linux, but what makes it more difficult than Ubuntu, in my opinion, is that its documentation is less comprehensive, its Wiki is more outdated and lastly support via official channels (like its AskBot website, Ask Fedora) is usually less in quality and swiftness of responses than Ubuntu. Generally speaking I find installing software that is not in the official repositories (e.g., later versions of [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)) or that require configuration after they are installed with a package manager (e.g., [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)) is more difficult on Fedora than on either Arch Linux or Ubuntu.

Fedora also has a developmental release called Fedora Rawhide that can be called a bleeding-edge rolling release edition, but I would not as a bleeding-edge rolling release model means, to me, at least, that while the system may be using the latest software it only uses the latest **stable releases** of its software (or at least its system software) and not the latest **developmental releases** of its software. Rawhide uses the latest **developmental releases** of its system software (including its kernel) and because of this bugs that prevent users from booting a Rawhide installation are not uncommon.

It is presently ranked 5th for popularity according to the *DistroWatch* website.

### Installer
Fedora uses the [**Anaconda**](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda) installer, which has been ported to a few other Linux distributions as well, including [Sabayon Linux](#sabayon-linux). According to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda) it is 87.8% written in Python, 7.9% written in C and 4% written in Bash script.

I have successfully managed to install Fedora 23 LXDE edition on my removable drive, although it failed to connect to the Wi-Fi by default. I had to install additional drivers by following [this guide](https://onpub.com/install-broadcom-linux-wi-fi-driver-on-fedora-23-s7-a192) while connected to a wired (or ethernet) Internet connection.

### Package Management
As previously mentioned later releases of Fedora use DNF (from the command-line [`dnf`](/man/dnf.8.html)) as their default command-line package manager, with PackageKit being an officially-supported graphical front-end for DNF. DNF is essentially the same as yum (including the fact that it is mostly written in Python), except with faster dependency-resolution thanks to that fact it uses ZYpp's libsolv library for this. Its syntax is virtually identical to that of yum, below are some examples. There are over 21,000 binary packages in its repositories.[^4]

### Derivatives
{% include_relative derivatives.md os="Fedora" %}
Fedora has quite a few derivative distributions, although nowhere near as many as Debian has. The most notable derivatives, besides [CentOS](#centos), its derivative Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and RHEL's derivatives (like [Oracle Linux](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=oracle)) are probably:

* [BLAG Linux And GNU](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=blag), is a British Fedora derivative that uses the Linux-libre kernel and adheres to the Free Software Foundation's requirements for a free GNU/Linux distribution. I have not been able to use it as the download links on their website have experienced [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot). It is presently ranked 202nd on the *DistroWatch* website for popularity.
* [Chapeau](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=chapeau), a British Fedora derivative which I have installed on a VM. Its major distinguishing feature from Fedora is the fact that it has a more relaxed stance on package licensing terms and only supports 64-bit processors. It is presently ranked 242nd for popularity according to the *DistroWatch* website.
* [Korora](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=korora), an Australian Fedora derivative that I have also installed on a VM. It has a few extra tools (that I have hardly even used) and its releases usually lag a few months behind the corresponding Fedora releases they are built on. Its artwork is also a distinguishing feature (which I rather like). It is presently ranked 45th for popularity according to the *DistroWatch* website.
