### Background
{% include_relative os.md os="antiX" d="http://antix.mepis.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Downloads" url="http://antix.mepis.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" forum="http://antix.freeforums.org/" dw="antix" wp="antiX" %} is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Debian's 'Testing' branch for 32-bit (i486 or better) and 64-bit systems. It is essentially designed to be a lightweight distribution as it uses the IceWM window manager as its default user interface. I have found it fairly user-friendly with a graphical installer and a fresh install takes up less than 3 GB hard disk drive (HDD) space. A fresh install can also work with as little as 128 MB RAM, although a minimum of 256 MB is recommended. Compared to more popular Linux distributions such as its parent Debian, its own documentation is fairly minimal, although as it is a Debian derivative the documentation of Debian should suffice in most cases. Since it is built on the testing branch of Debian its system software is usually bleeding edge, in terms of how up-to-date it is.
