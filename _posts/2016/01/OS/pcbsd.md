### Background
{% include_relative os.md os="PC-BSD" url="http://www.pcbsd.org/" forum="https://forums.pcbsd.org/" wiki="http://wiki.pcbsd.org/index.php/Main_Page" wp="PC-BSD" ircs="pcbsd" ml="http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo" d="http://www.pcbsd.org/en/download.html" dw="pcbsd" docs="http://www.pcbsd.org/en/documentation/" %} is a free and open-source desktop-oriented [**FreeBSD**](https://www.freebsd.org/) derivative. It is built on the latest release of FreeBSD and has some graphical tools to aid in the installation and usage of the system. The default desktop environment of PC-BSD is KDE Plasma 4 (KDE Plasma 5 is still not available on it, as of {{ page.date | date: "%d %B %Y" }}, see [this forum post](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/kde-plasma-5.47280/) for details), although other desktops are available for installation via its default package management system (PMS) as mentioned in the [Package Management](#toc52) section.

You may have noticed this is the only BSD derivative compared in this post, this is because while I have tried FreeBSD and [GhostBSD](http://ghostbsd.org/) only PC-BSD I have used enough to be able to review. FreeBSD itself is, by default, a command-line operating system with no graphical installers or GUIs. GUIs can be installed by those with the know-how and inclination to, but they are not included by default. I have tried to install GUIs on FreeBSD 10.2, including KDE Plasma 4, but it failed to load. GhostBSD, on the other hand, has the problem of being based on the second-latest release of FreeBSD (e.g., as of {{ page.date | date: "%d %B %Y" }}, the latest release of GhostBSD is based on FreeBSD 10.1 and FreeBSD 10.2 is presently available). FreeBSD is currently ranked at 27th on the *DistroWatch* website for popularity amongst the &#42;nix operating systems it ranks, while PC-BSD is ranked 43rd and GhostBSD is ranked 68th.

### Package Management
{% include_relative os-shot.html image="AppCafe.png" width="1130px" float="none" description="AppCafe, the graphical user interface for the pkg package management system" %}
PC-BSD, like its parent FreeBSD, uses **pkg** ([`pkg`](/man/pkg.7.html) from the command-line) and the **ports system** ([here](/man/ports.7.html) is its manpage) for command-line package management, although unlike FreeBSD a graphical front-end for pkg called **AppCafe** is also included in a default installation of PC-BSD. `pkg` is FreeBSD's binary package manager, while the ports system is an installation method that involves installing software from source code contained in subdirectories of `/usr/ports`. One does this by changing into the subdirectory of the package you want and running {% include Code/coder.html line1="make install" %} Just like with Gentoo's Portage package manager (which is inspired by FreeBSD's ports) one will need to occasionally update the contents of the ports system, to ensure that the software is up-to-date. One does this by running: {% include Code/coder.html line1="portsnap fetch && portsnap extract" %} Unlike Portage, however, the ports system does not perform dependency resolution for you, rather you have to manually install all the dependencies for the package you want using either ports or pkg.

I have personally found pkg and its graphical front-end **very** prone to unresolvable errors, for example, at the time of writing this post I have booted my PC-BSD VM and used AppCafe to upgrade my VM's packages and it gave out the fatal error:

Likewise using `pkg` for upgrades gives the error documented in this [forum post](https://forums.pcbsd.org/thread-20354.html) I started.
