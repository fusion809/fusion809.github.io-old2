### Bash
{% include Links/links.html package="app-shells/bash" program="Bash" category="dev-bash" %} is the most commonly-encountered Unix shell and command language. Few have compared its speed to other programming languages, hence I cannot provide an average for it. Despite this I know that for most things it is considered slower than Python. Most code written for Bash should also be compatible with Zsh, although whether it is compatible with the syntax of other Unix shells is something I cannot comment on. The programming language of Unix shells, in general (that is, not with particular reference to any specific shell like Bash), is usually called **shell script**. Shell script, with some particular reference to Bash and Zsh, is the programming language I have, by far, the most experience with. For an introduction to the Bash syntax, see [*An Introduction to Bash Scripting for Sabayon Users*](/bash-scripting-and-the-command-line-an-introduction-for-sabayon-users/). Due to the fact it is a Unix shell, it is not considered cross-platform.
