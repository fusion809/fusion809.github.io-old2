### C
**C** was originally developed for use by Research Unix, by Dennis Ritchie (1941-2011), while he was working at Bell Labs. Since then it has become one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world. The reason for this is several fold, *firstly*, it is cross-platform and able to run on most, if not all, computing platforms, *secondly*, it is fast and *thirdly*, it is powerful, giving developers complete control over their program. It was originally considered high-level, but it has since become considered low-level, and its low-level nature is best illustrated by the fact that developers have to allocate memory to their program manually. The most popular free compiler of C is the GCC.

Programs written, predominantly, in it, that I have experience with, include:

* {% include Links/wp.md name="Bash" %} &mdash; the Unix shell is predominantly written in C.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="dpkg" %} (dpkg)[^1], the default package manager of Debian and its derivatives like Ubuntu.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="FreeBSD" %} &mdash; the Unix-like operating system, is predominantly written in C.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="GIMP" %} &mdash; a free and open-source photo-editing program, with similar features to Adobe Photoshop.
{% include Links/image.html image="Graphics/GIMP-2.8-editing.png" width="1100px" float="none" %}
* {% include Links/wp.md name="GNU Coreutils" %} &mdash; the command-line utilities package for &#42;nix systems is written predominantly in C.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="GTK+" %} or the GIMP Toolkit &mdash; is a free widget toolkit developed for use by the GNOME desktop environment.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="Linux kernel" %} &mdash; the kernel of Linux operating systems.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="VLC media player" %} (71.2% C, 17.7% C++, 6.7% Objective-C, 1.3% Lua, *etc.* according to GitHub[^2]) &mdash; a free and open-source cross-platform multimedia player. Its main advantage over its competitors is that it supports virtually every media type. It uses the Qt widget toolkit, so this is where some of the C++ comes from in its source code.
