### Java
{% include Links/links.html program="Java" category="dev-java" %} is a cross-platform programming language, in its early days it was proprietary-licensed, until it was later released under the GNU GPL license. Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world today, in fact, the TIOBE is currently ranking it number 1 for popularity, in the programming world. Java applications are usually compiled into its own instruction set called {% include Links/wp.md name="Java bytecode" puncr="," %} that can then be run in a {% include Links/wp.md name="Java Virtual Machine" %}  (JVM) regardless of the computer's architecture or operating system. This is what makes it cross-platform and this is key to its success. The GCC includes a Java compiler.

There are quite a few programs I have used that are written, mostly, in Java, they include:

* {% include Links/wp.md name="jEdit" %} &mdash; a free (GPL-licensed) text editor with support for several computer languages.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="Jmol" %} &mdash; a free 3D molecule viewer, that can import the molecule formats `.cif`, `.mol`, `.pdb`, `.sdf`, *etc.*
* {% include Links/wp.md name="NetBeans" %} &mdash; a once proprietary Java IDE, now it is free licensed under GPL-compatible licenses.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="RuneScape" %} &mdash; a proprietary massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).
* {% include Links/wp.md name="SPSS" %} &mdash; a proprietary program used for statistical analysis.
* {% include Links/wp.md name="Vuze" %} &mdash; a BitTorrent client.
