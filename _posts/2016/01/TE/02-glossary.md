## Glossary

### Acronyms
* **CE**: **Community Edition**. Some programs have both community (usually indicated they are licensed under a GPL-compatible FOSS license) and proprietary (sometimes alternatively named like Ultimate Edition in the case of IntelliJ IDEA) editions.

### Command-Line Interface
A [**command-line interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (**CLI**) or **command-line interpreter** is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with their computer by issuing a series of commands. On &#42;nix systems the most common type of CLI are [Unix shells](#unix-shells).

### Fork
In the field of software development a [**fork**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) is when software developers take a copy of a project's source code and start working on it independently of its previous developers. Proprietary software licenses do not usually allow for forks except with the expressed permission of the software's previous developer(s). In the FOSS community forks are common due to the fact that FOSS licenses permit the creation of forks without the previous developer(s)'s permission.

### Graphical User Interface
A [**graphical user interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (**GUI**) is a type of interface that allows users to interact with their computer using graphical icons and visual indicators. This is as opposed to command-line interfaces (CLIs) and textual user interfaces (TUIs), in which users interact with the computer by issuing lines of commands or by writing textual responses to prompts. The most notable type of GUI found on many &#42;nix systems is that of a desktop environment like Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, LXDE, MATE, Xfce, *etc.*

### Integrated Development Environment
An {% include Links/wpb.md name="Integrated Development Environment" %} (**IDE**) is a program that provides users, supposedly comprehensive, facilities for software development. I used the word "<i>supposedly</i>", to draw attention to the fact that the definition of comprehensive does vary quite substantially from IDE to IDE. IDEs are almost universally also [text editors](#text-editor), and it is quite often difficult to distinguish the more feature-packed text editors from IDEs.

### IDE Features
IDEs possess several features that are supposed to distinguish them from standard TEs, these features include:

* **In-built implementation support**: in other words, the ability to implement (compile or interpret, depending on the programming language) the files being edited or created in the IDE.
* **Project Views**: this is my way of saying that usually in IDEs you can navigate the contents of a project folder, editing each file therein without having to open up a new IDE window.

### Text Editor
A {% include Links/wpb.md name="Text editor" %} (**TE**) is any program that can be used to edit text files, they are particularly invaluable to computer programmers because they can be used to edit software source code or document markup.
