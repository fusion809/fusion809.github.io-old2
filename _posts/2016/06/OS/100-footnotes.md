## Footnotes
[^1]: Systems that are entirely free and open-source I will refer to as *libre* to distinguish them from those that are not.
[^2]: Which can be a little complicated for those of us with Broadcom Wi-Fi chips, due to the proprietary firmware these devices require not being in the official Arch Linux repositories.
[^3]: This is for the simplest scenario, in which you wish to install GRUB2 on the same disk as you have Arch installed. This disk should also have either a MBR or GPT partition table. Further details can be found in the [GRUB2 article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB) at *The ArchWiki*.
[^4]: Further details can be found at *The ArchWiki*'s article on [systemd-boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot).
[^5]: If you are an Arch developer, or otherwise knowledgeable about Arch Linux, you may be thinking that I am wrong to include the `[community]` repository as an official Arch repository. I am including it, because it is maintained by a group of people (that is, trusted users) that are elected by the Arch community, it contains precompiled binaries, it is stored in the Arch Linux official servers, *etc.*
