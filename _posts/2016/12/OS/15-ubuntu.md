## Ubuntu
{% include_relative infoboxes/15-ubuntu.html %}

[**Ubuntu**](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is a Linux distribution developed by a community of volunteers, along with Canonical Ltd employees and that is sponsored by Canonical Ltd. Canonical Ltd. is a company founded and funded by Mark Shuttleworth, a South African entrepeneur and astronaut. He also leads the development of Ubuntu, although the community of volunteer developers also has a say in its development. Shuttleworth was a volunteer contributor to the Debian operating system in the 1990s and when he created the Ubuntu operating system he decided to base it on Debian. Like Debian Ubuntu uses the APT and dpkg package management systems. It also uses a similar file system layout to that of Debian. Despite being developed by a company Ubuntu is a free product, and Canonical Ltd instead makes its money by selling paid support for Ubuntu to business that use it. 

Ubuntu, by default, does not come with any proprietary software that I am aware of, aside from the binary blobs on its kernel. Despite this its official repositories do contain some proprietary drivers like the Broadcom wireless driver. It is designed to be fairly out-of-the-box, but it does not have out-of-the-box support for Broadcom wireless. It also has several different official editions, including:

* Edubuntu, which only exists for LTS releases of Ubuntu. It is education-oriented, primarily intended for children. 
* Kubuntu (using KDE)
* Lubuntu (using LXDE)
* Ubuntu GNOME (using GNOME)
* Ubuntu Kylin, which is intended for Chinese speakers due to its superior Chinese language support. 
* Ubuntu MATE (using MATE)
* Xubuntu (using Xfce)
