## Gentoo Linux
{% include_relative infoboxes/07-gentoo.html %}

[**Gentoo Linux**](https://www.gentoo.org/) is a Linux distribution that uses its own package manager, Portage, that is so named because it is similar to FreeBSD's Ports system. Portage compiles and installs software from source code by following instructions in a specialized type of shell script known as an ebuild. These ebuilds are stored in repositories that are usually git-controlled and are referred to as overlays. The official Gentoo overlay is also known as the Portage Tree and is stored on a Gentoo system in the `/usr/portage` directory. Unofficial overlays are installed via the official tool (that is, it is developed by the Gentoo Linux development team) `layman` to `/var/lib/layman`. Despite it serving as a source package manager by default, Portage can also install pre-built binary packages.

ebuilds usually include USE flag and keyword fields. USE flags are essentially options that determine which features of the package provided by the ebuild are built and which are not. For example, the `gtk` USE flag, if enabled, would cause one's packages to be built with GTK widget toolkit support. Likewise keywords tell one the stability of the ebuild on the various processor architectures Gentoo has been ported to. For example, the `amd64` keyword means that the ebuild is stable (and well-tested) on AMD64 (or x86-64) platforms. Likewise the `~x86` keyword means that the ebuild is unstable on x86 (or 32-bit systems).

Portage is a complicated package manager to use too. Frequently Portage will complain of an error (most often a package or USE flag conflict) and exit, leaving the user to fix whatever is wrong. For advanced users this is usually no problem, but for less sophisticated users it can be a deal-breaker. I used to hate Portage when I used Sabayon Linux for a few months as my primary OS. Mostly because it seemed like I always got errors from Portage whenever I tried to install packages. It took a fair bit of effort for me to learn the basics of Portage error-fixing. Nowadays while I do not have Sabayon installed on any of the partitions of my day-to-day PC, I still use Portage on a weekly basis (roughly), which is roughly how often I fire up my Gentoo Linux VirtualBox VM and update it using the commands:
