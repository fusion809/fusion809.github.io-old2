## FreeBSD
{% include_relative infoboxes/06-freebsd.html %}

[**FreeBSD**](https://www.freebsd.org/) is the only operating system included in this comparison that is not a Linux distribution, rather it is a &#42;BSD derivative, putting it in the same category as DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. It is developed by a group of some 500 developers (or committers), most of whom are unpaid volunteers, although some are paid to contribute to it by their respective business. Among these developers a "core team" of 9 are selected by the FreeBSD committer community and given special authority to act on the behalf of the FreeBSD project to set and enforce project rules, approve (or reject) new FreeBSD committers, granting them SVN access and setting direction for the FreeBSD project. FreeBSD packages can be built from source code, with custom configure options set using the Ports system, or installed from pre-installed binaries using the `pkg` binary package manager.

FreeBSD is the third eldest operating system mentioned in this post, after Debian and Slackware, and some of its source code has been borrowed to make the [Darwin operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)), upon which macOS is built. It was forked from 386BSD, a project in early 1990s to port the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) that was originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley, to the Intel 80386 set of microprocessors.
