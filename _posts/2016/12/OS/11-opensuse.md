[**openSUSE**](https://www.opensuse.org/) is a popular Linux distribution that traces its origins back to the early 1990s, when a group of German computer science/mathematics students decided to create their own Linux system and sell it on floppy disks. They also founded a company to sell the floppy disks and called it S.u.S.E. (short for the German name Software und System Entwicklung mbH). Later the full name (from which the acronym was derived) was dropped but they kept the acronym and they changed it to SuSE, then later SUSE and finally to SUSE Linux. SUSE Linux was eventually acquired by Novell and, in 2005, the openSUSE Project was launched. Unlike SUSE (which is now defunct, and has been largely replaced with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) which was launched in 2001), openSUSE's development is open to the public (as opposed to be kept in-house at SUSE) and the public is encouraged to contribute (via submitting patches and bug report).

Its default package manager is [ZYpp](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Libzypp) (which is invoked by the command `zypper`), which has the official graphical front-end [YaST](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST).
