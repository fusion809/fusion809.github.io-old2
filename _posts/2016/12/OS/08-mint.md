## Linux Mint
{% include_relative infoboxes/08-mint.html %}

[**Linux Mint**](https://linuxmint.com/) is one of the most popular Linux distributions available (in fact according to [*DistroWatch*](http://distrowatch.com/) it is the most popular Linux distribution). It is a Ubuntu LTS derivative that has two official editions: one with MATE (which is designed to be used by older computers) and another with Cinnamon, a desktop environment specifically developed by Linux Mint developers for use by Linux Mint. I have personally only ever tried Linux Mint in a VirtualBox VM, but from what I can tell it is very similar to Ubuntu, except it has some home-grown applications to make system management easier.

It is ideal for users that like the Cinnamon/MATE desktop environments, like a beginner-friendly operating system, favour a fairly conservative yet stable distribution, in terms of how up-to-date its software is.
