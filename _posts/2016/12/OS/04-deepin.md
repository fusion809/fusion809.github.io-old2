[**deepin**](https://www.deepin.org/?lang=en) is a beginner-friendly Chinese Linux distribution built from Debian's unstable branch. It comes with its own desktop environment pre-installed, the so called Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE). This desktop environment used to be built using web technologies, but in late 2015 it was re-written and built on the Qt 5 widget toolkit. It is less customizable than most desktop environments and I have personally found it a little buggy. DDE is designed to be intuitive, and includes several home-grown core applications such as Deepin Software Center, DMusic and DPlayer.
