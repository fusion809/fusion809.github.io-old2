[**deepin**](https://www.deepin.org/?lang=en) is a beginner-friendly Chinese Linux distribution built from Debian's unstable branch. Despite being largely based on Debian's unstable branch there are several differences I have noticed. For one, it uses the latest LTS kernel, presently the 4.4.x series. Secondly, it contains some proprietary firmware that is not found in the Debian (unstable) repository. It comes with its own desktop environment pre-installed, the so called Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE). This desktop environment used to be built using web technologies, but in late 2015 it was re-written and built on the Qt 5 widget toolkit. It is less customizable than most desktop environments and I have personally found it a little buggy. DDE is designed to be intuitive, and includes several home-grown core applications such as Deepin Software Center, DMusic and DPlayer. It is unusual amongst Linux distributions, in that as far as I can tell (do correct me if I am wrong), it is developed only by paid employees of the company Wuhan Deepin Technology Co., Ltd. and not by community volunteers.

It comes with several pieces of proprietary software pre-installed. It comes with Spotify pre-installed, along with Broadcom wireless drivers.
