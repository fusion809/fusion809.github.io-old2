[**deepin**][400] is a beginner-friendly Chinese Linux distribution built from Debian's unstable branch. Despite being largely based on Debian's unstable branch there are a few differences I have noticed. For one, it uses the latest LTS kernel, presently the 4.9.x series, as opposed to Debian (unstable) which usually uses a more bleeding-edge kernel. Secondly, it contains some proprietary firmware that is not found in the Debian (unstable) repository.

It comes with its own desktop environment pre-installed, the so called Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE). This desktop environment used to be built using web technologies, but in late 2015 it was re-written and built on the Qt 5 widget toolkit. It is less customizable than most desktop environments and I have personally found it a little buggy. DDE is designed to be intuitive, and includes several home-grown core applications such as Deepin Software Center, DMusic and DPlayer. It is unusual amongst Linux distributions, in that as far as I can tell (do correct me if I am wrong), it is developed only by paid employees of the company Wuhan Deepin Technology Co., Ltd. and not by community volunteers. It is also unusual in that it comes with several pieces of proprietary software pre-installed, including Spotify and Broadcom wireless drivers.

### Closing remarks
Its ideal users are those that:

* Prefer a beginner-friendly distribution. Not all users of beginner distributions are novice-level Linux users. For example, I used to triple boot Arch Linux, Fedora and Ubuntu LTS. Ubuntu LTS is a beginner distribution, but I did not use it for the hand-holding that comes with beginner distributions, I used it because it had some of the best support for my favourite proprietary apps (like Spotify and RuneScape) in the Linux world, uses a fast package manager (APT) that I do not mind, is fairly polished and stable (hence I do not have to spend large portions of my days running it swatting bugs), and has a long release cycle (hence I do not have to perform distribution upgrades all that frequently), *etc.*
* Favour an out-of-the-box distribution over a distribution with a focus on open-source software only.
* Prefer distributions with fairly extensive repositories.
* Understand Mandarin Chinese. Not a necessity, as English support is available, but Mandarin Chinese would likely give one an edge on their online forums and other parts of their website.
* Like the Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE), macOS users will likely favour it as its [default look][401] is similar to that of macOS.
