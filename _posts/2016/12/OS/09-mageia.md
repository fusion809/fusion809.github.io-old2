## Mageia
{% include_relative infoboxes/09-mageia.html %}

[**Mageia**](http://www.mageia.org/en/) is a Linux distribution descended from the no-longer maintained French Linux distribution, Mandriva Linux, and developed by former employees of the company that developed Mandriva Linux, Mandriva S.A. Like its parent it utilizes the [urpmi](https://wiki.mageia.org/en/URPMI) package manager. It is somewhere between Ubuntu LTS and Debian (stable), in terms of how out-of-date, yet stable its software is. The latest stable release of Mageia, Mageia 5.1, ships with KDE Plasma 4, GNOME 3.14 and the 4.4.x series of the Linux kernel. Making it roughly as out-of-date as Debian 8, except with a newer kernel. Its repositories are probably second only to Slackware, in terms of how few pieces of software are included in them. They mostly just contain desktop environment packages, core packages (like the kernel and GNU coreutils) and some packages common to virtually every Linux distribution (like GNU Emacs). Like many other Linux distributions Mageia follows a fixed release model, but there is also a rolling release, developmental version of Mageia, known as Mageia Cauldron. 

Mageia is best suited to intermediate or advanced users that:

* Love open-source, but not enough to remove the binary blobs from one's kernel.
* Do not require out-of-the-box support for devices with proprietary drivers such as Broadcom WiFi chips. 
* Are comfortable using the urpmi package manager. I personally dislike the urpmi package manager's syntax, as I find it even more confusing than APT's.
