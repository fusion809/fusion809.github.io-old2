## Mageia
{% include_relative infoboxes/09-mageia.html %}

[**Mageia**](http://www.mageia.org/en/) is a Linux distribution descended from the no-longer maintained French Linux distribution, Mandriva Linux, and developed by former employees of the company that developed Mandriva Linux, Mandriva S.A. Like its parent it utilizes the [urpmi](https://wiki.mageia.org/en/URPMI) package manager. It is somewhere between Ubuntu LTS and Debian (stable), in terms of how out-of-date, yet stable its software is. Like many other Linux distributions it follows a fixed release model, but there is also a rolling release, developmental version of Mageia, known as Mageia Cauldron.
