## Sabayon Linux
{% include_relative infoboxes/13-sabayon.html %}

[**Sabayon Linux**](https://www.sabayon.org/) is a Linux distribution that is donation-sponsored and developed by a team of volunteer developers. It is derived from Gentoo Linux and shares its package manager, along with its own binary package manager, Entropy. All packages installed with Entropy were originally built using Portage's `ebuild` command. 

Sabayon was founded in 2005 by Fabio Erculiani, an Italian software engineer, as an out-of-the-box Gentoo derivative. Later in 2008 he started working on a binary package manager for Sabayon, that like Gentoo's package manager Portage, was written in Python and Shell script. Its first stable release was in 2011. 

Sabayon is a very out-of-the-box Linux distribution with support for Broadcom wireless. It aims to be on the bleeding-edge but it is more conservative (that is, it is closer to the stable side of the spectrum) than the more true "bleeding-edge" distributions like: Arch Linux and Gentoo Linux. Its choice of web browser to ship with is also unusual. Most distributions ship with an open-source web browser like Firefox, while Sabayon ships with Google Chrome, a proprietary web browser.
