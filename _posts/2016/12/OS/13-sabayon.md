## Sabayon Linux
{% include_relative infoboxes/13-sabayon.html %}

[**Sabayon Linux**][1300] is a beginner-friendly Linux distribution that is donation-sponsored and developed by a team of volunteer developers. It is derived from Gentoo Linux and shares its package manager, along with its own binary package manager, Entropy. All packages installed with Entropy were originally built using Portage's `ebuild` command. Like Ubuntu it has a few different official editions each with a different default user interface. Like there is a minimal edition (with Fluxbox and Xorg, by default), GNOME edition, KDE edition, MATE edition, Xfce edition and server edition (which has no GUI).

Sabayon was founded in 2005 by Fabio Erculiani, an Italian software engineer, as an out-of-the-box Gentoo derivative. Later in 2008 he started working on a binary package manager for Sabayon, that like Gentoo's package manager Portage, was written in Python and Shell script. Its first stable release was in 2011. Erculiani remains the sole maintainer of the Entropy package manager, periodically tagging new releases from its [GitHub repository][1301]. Entropy has two available front-ends: a command-line one (Equo) and a graphical one (Rigo). Equo is one of the slower command-line binary Linux package managers, probably because it is written in an interpreted language namely Python which is inherently slower than the equivalent package manager written in compiled languages like C. Despite this it is the fastest package manager I have used that is written predominantly in an interpreted language like Perl or Python. 

### Package management and default packages
Sabayon is a very out-of-the-box Linux distribution with support for Broadcom wireless. It aims to be on the bleeding-edge but it is more conservative (that is, it is closer to the stable side of the spectrum) than the more truly "bleeding-edge" distributions like Arch Linux and Gentoo Linux. For example, it still uses Xorg 1.18.4 at the time of writing, when Xorg 1.19.0 has been out for over two months (see the infobox for more packages that are rather out-of-date for a bleeding-edge distro). Its pieces of application software (e.g., CodeLite, Eclipse, *etc.*) that are not part of an included desktop environment's core application suite, tend to lag behind too, as there were only two people maintaining its repositories last time I asked (which was only a few months ago). 

Entropy's repositories are not super-comprehensive (but they do contain over 13,000 packages), in-my-opinion, which is not surprising given there's only two people maintaining its official repositories. Several pieces of software are missing from them, especially mathematics/proprietary pieces of software such as RuneScape's NXT Client, SageMath and Scilab. I personally have not used them, but I hear that Sabayon has recently added Sabayon Community Repositories (SCR), which may allow users to more easily get the software they want that are not available in the Entropy repositories. 

Sabayon also uses its own custom-branded [kernel sources][1302] ([`sys-kernel/sabayon-sources`][1303]) that Erculiani maintains. Several different supported versions of the Linux kernel are in their official repositories and can be installed with Entropy.

Its choice of web browser to ship with is also unusual. Most distributions ship with an open-source web browser like Firefox, while Sabayon ships with Google Chrome, a proprietary web browser. I also find that GNOME is updated fairly slowly after an upstream minor/major release (as opposed to a bug fix release; usually bug fix releases are integrated into the repositories fairly quickly), probably because the Portage Tree, which contains most of the ebuilds used by Sabayon developers to build Sabayon's GNOME packages, usually are updated fairly slowly after a major/minor GNOME update. For example, it took months before GNOME 3.18 entered the Sabayon repositories after its source code was released upstream.

### Installer
Sabayon used to use its own custom branded version of the Calamares installer, although before this it (circa mid 2015) used a re-branded version of Fedora's Anaconda installer. It was abandoned, in favour of the Calamares installer, due to its perceived propensity for bugs. Although in mid 2016 they switched back to Anaconda yet again, due to issues with Calamares. 

### Impressions of its community
I should warn folks though, that I have found the Sabayon developers (especially in their IRC channel, not so much in their forums) rather testy, quick to anger (or at least being rude), even when one is not trying to insult them, merely asking questions out of curiosity about the distribution. But that could just be me (or my timing as Sabayon developers only work on Sabayon in their spare time and I could have caught them on a bad day after they got home from work), I do not know why but I seem to get under their skin when that is furthest from my intentions. Sabayon is a fairly unpopular distribution compared to the others mentioned in this post, so naturally there are fewer people on their forums that are available for answering one's questions. So I would personally rank their forums as inferior (in terms of mostly, response time. Quality is still pretty good though) to that of Arch Linux and Manjaro Linux, and the Ask sites of Fedora and Ubuntu. 

### Closing remarks
Ideal Sabayon users are those that:

* Enjoy using a beginner-friendly distribution.
* Like having the freedom to customize one's distribution, but not having to (as doing so can be quite tedious and, at times, frustrating), if one is happy with Sabayon's defaults. One can theoretically create an entirely custom Sabayon installation by using the server edition of Sabayon and setting up everything from the ground-up. 
* Want a fairly bleeding-edge, yet still rather stable distribution.
* Do not require any obscure/insufficiently popular (among Sabayon users/developers at least, as otherwise they would be in the Entropy repositories) pieces of software like RuneScape's NXT Client, SageMath or Scilab, or if one does are willing to and able to build and install said packages using Portage. 
* Do not require much support. 
* Do not mind having a fairly slow package manager. I personally find using Entropy annoying at times because when one has several packages upgrades to get it can take well over half an hour to download and install them. 
* Do not have any qualms about using a distribution that is not entirely open-source.
