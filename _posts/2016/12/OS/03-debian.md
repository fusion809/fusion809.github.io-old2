## Debian
{% include_relative infoboxes/03-debian.html %}

[**Debian**](https://www.debian.org/) is one of the oldest Linux distributions still in active development, second only to Slackware Linux. Ian Murdock started developing it in 1993 (when he was 20 years old) and he named it as a portmanteau of the first name of Debra Lynn, his then girlfriend, and his own first name (Deb + Ian = Debian). Debian and its derivatives make up most of the usage share of Linux distributions on the desktop and laptop. Debian and Ubuntu (a Debian derivative) also make up the majority of the usage share of Linux distributions on servers. Debian has four stable branches (each with different repositories, different purposes, different derivatives and different usage shares):

* [Oldstable](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianOldStable) &mdash; the previous stable release, presently Wheezy (7).
* [Stable](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable) &mdash; the current stable release, presently Jessie (8). Debian stable usually has packages in its repositories that are two or three years old. For example, Debian 8 still uses KDE4 despite KDE Plasma 5 coming out in July 2014.
* [Testing](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting) &mdash; which will become the next stable release, presently Stretch (9).
* [Unstable (sid)](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable) &mdash; a bleeding-edge rolling release version of Debian.

Debian is the so called, "The universal operating system", probably because it is open-source, customizable and suitable for a wide variety of different platforms. In fact it is the Linux distribution that has been ported to the greatest number of processor architectures. It has even been ported to FreeBSD and GNU Hurd kernels. It uses the APT and dpkg package managers. dpkg provides lower-level package management services, being used for removing, installing and upgrading software packages. APT provides higher-level utilities such as repository management, package downloading, dependency resolution, *etc.*
