**Arch Linux** is a minimalist Linux distribution that follows a bleeding-edge rolling release model. It started out in early 2001 as a side project of Judd Vinet, a Canadian programmer. He was inspired by the *simplicity* of the &#42;BSDs and Slackware, amongst other operating systems available at the time, but disappointed by their lack of suitable package management systems. So he devised a lightweight and simple package manager specifically for Arch Linux and called it pacman. Its first public release was in March 2002.<a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> What is meant by *simplicity* in this context is without unnecessary additions or changes. It also means with the minimum set of default, pre-installed software. It is more oriented towards advanced users, specifically users that are:

* Comfortable with the command-line. If you are uncomfortable with the command-line you will likely struggle during the initial stage of setting up Arch Linux.
