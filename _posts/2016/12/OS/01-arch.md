[**Arch Linux**](https://www.archlinux.org/) is a minimalist Linux distribution that follows a bleeding-edge rolling release model. It started out in early 2001 as a side project of Judd Vinet, a Canadian programmer. He was inspired by the *simplicity* of the &#42;BSDs and Slackware, amongst other operating systems available at the time, but disappointed by their lack of suitable package management systems. So he devised a lightweight and simple package manager specifically for Arch Linux and called it pacman. What is meant by *simplicity* in this context is without unnecessary additions or changes. It also means with the minimum set of default, pre-installed software. Arch Linux's first public release was in March 2002.<a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> It is more oriented towards advanced users, specifically users that are:

* Comfortable with the command-line. If one is uncomfortable with the command-line one will likely struggle during the initial stage of setting up Arch Linux. It will likely also be a problem later as system management and installing new packages is best (but not strictly necessarily) done from the command-line. Some unofficial graphical tools for package management do exist, like Octopi and Pamac, but they are not officially supported.
* Able to handle system-breaking bugs, like kernel bugs that prevent the system from booting.
* Know how to write a good, detailed, well-written forum question. The Arch Linux forum community can get quite rude if one does not write one's questions well and detailed.
* Do not want to compile (most) their packages from source. Some software (such as that in the Arch User Repository (AUR)) has to be compiled from source, unless one wishes to use an unofficial, potentially dangerous repository, that may contain the AUR packages one wants.
