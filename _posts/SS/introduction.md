On [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution), along with other [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)/[Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems,[^1] the command-line is a pivotal way by which users can interact with the operating system, the files stored on it and the system's various components. The command-line on such systems is usually accessed via so called &ldquo;**[terminal emulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)**&rdquo;, which start and allow users to interact with their [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell). It is Unix shells that really serve as the command-line of &#42;nix systems and from within them various command-line programs can be called and used to perform specific tasks. Examples of such programs include `cp`, `find`, `ls`, `rm`, *etc.* In fact, one of the defining properties of all &#42;nix systems is that they share a set of basic command-line utilities that perform specific and usually singular tasks. On Linux platforms these basic utilities are usually provided by the [**GNU Core Utilities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities) package and the Unix shell used is usually **[Bash](https://en.wikipdia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))**.

**Bash**, which is abbreviated from the **Bourne-again shell**, is a Unix shell and command language, that is developed as part of the [GNU Project](http://www.gnu.org/). Along with the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) and [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager), I would rank Bash as one of the three most important components of a Sabayon Linux system. Without it or some other Unix shell in its place, one's ability to interact one's system would be very limited and difficult. Bash was originally developed by [Brian J. Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)) in 1989 and has since become the most-widely used Unix shell, with the vast majority of Linux distributions using it as their default command shell (only notable exception I have come across is [Deepin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepin), which uses Zsh) and since the release of 10.3 in October 2003 is has replaced tcsh as the default command shell for [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X).

In this post I will give provide an introduction to the &#42;nix command-line, including some available terminal emulators, Unix shells, with some focus on Bash and how all this relates to Sabayon users. It is important to remember I am not an expert on Bash, Bash scripting or programming in general, I have even had doubts I could even write this blog post. It is important to note too that this post is nowhere near *comprehensive* on this topic, as the only type of text I, or anyone, could write that would be comprehensive on this topic would be an entire several-hundred page book, not a dozen-or-so-page blog post. This post just gives you some of the tools to do many of the basic things a novice or intermediate user of Sabayon would like to be able to do with Bash.
