### C++
**C++** (pronounced *See-plus-plus*) is a programming language that was originally developed by Bjarne Stroustrup (1950-) while he was working at Bell Labs. Stroustrup wanted a programming language with similar features and speed to C, except with greater support for additional programming paradigms as well as some extra high-level features. Its most popular free compiler is probably the GCC too. The list of programs written mostly in C++ is very long and includes:
