## Directory Structure
Jekyll sites have the following directory structure:
{% include Code/gist.html id="838d04bda42897fd7167" %}
where `()` are optional folders (some of which like `_data`, `images` and `js` are ones *The Hornery* uses, but are not widely used by Jekyll sites in general) or files that are not included by default, `{}` denotes folders or files generated by Bundler and `[]` denotes folders or files I would recommend is listed in `.gitignore`. Further details on this can be found in the official documentation [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).
