### Background
**Enlightenment** is a free, BSD-licensed, eye-candy stacking window manager, that was originally developed in the mid 1990s by Carsten Haitzler, also known as Rasterman, whom is still its lead developer. When it was originally released there was only one version of Enlightenment which is now known as E16, but later in December 2012 E17 had its first stable release. E16 is very lightweight in terms of memory footprint and installed size, but it is also very basic. E17, on the other hand, and later releases in its series E18, E19 and E20, are heavier on memory footprint and installed size but also heavier on features.
