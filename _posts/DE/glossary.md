### [Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment)
The definition of a desktop environment (DE) varies according to whom you ask, but I will define a DE as a GUI consisting of at least three base components:

* **Display server**/**Windowing system** (**DS**/**WS**): which create and maintain windows within a GUI. The most popular examples on Linux platforms are Wayland and the X Window System.
* **File manager** (**FM**): which allow users the ability to search their file system within the GUI. Most DEs have their own unique FM, although some DEs share FMs with other desktops.
* **Widget toolkit** (**WT**). These are used to construct GUIs, most popular examples on Linux platforms are the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) and Qt.
* **Window manager** (**WM**). These are programs that control the appearance, placement and other details of windows within a windowing system. Most DEs use their own WM, although some share.
