## Glossary
The definition of a desktop environment (DE) varies according to whom you ask, but I will define a DE as a GUI consisting of at least four base components:

* **Display server**/**Windowing system**: which create and maintain windows within a GUI. The most popular examples on Linux platforms are Wayland and the X Window System.
* **Widget toolkit**. These are used to construct GUIs, most popular examples on Linux platforms are the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) and Qt.
* **Window manager**. These are programs that control the appearance, placement and other details of windows within a windowing system.
