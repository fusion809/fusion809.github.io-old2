## awesome
The [**awesome window manager**](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) is a [dynamic window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_manager) developed by Julien Danjou and others, that is oriented towards more advanced users. See unlike more beginner-friendly WMs, which can be configured graphically, awesome must be configured using Lua scripts. Now my knowledge of Lua is in its infancy, so needless to say my experience with awesome is also fairly limited. What I do know about Lua is that it is easier to learn than lower-level languages like C, C++ or Java.
