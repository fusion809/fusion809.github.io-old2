### Background
**GNOME** is a GTK+ based desktop environment that is developed as part of the GNU Project. It was founded in the late 1990s, when the Qt widget toolkit that the newly formed KDE desktop was based on, was still proprietary-licensed. The developers of GNOME created their own freely-licensed widget toolkit, which became known as the GIMP Toolkit or GTK+ for short, for GNOME to use. GNOME and KDE have been widely seen as the two major Linux desktop environments ever since. Each new series of GNOME, denoted by different integers (e.g., GNOME 1, GNOME 2 and GNOME 3), is based on a new series (also denoted by different integers, e.g., GTK+ 1, GTK+ 2, GTK+ 3) of the GIMP Toolkit. GNOME 1 was first officially released in March 1999, GNOME 2 was first released in June 2002 while GNOME 3 was released in April 2011.

GNOME 3 featured a new look (GNOME Shell) that broke with the traditional desktop metaphor and was met with much controversy and criticism in the FOSS community. Because of this around the time that GNOME 3 was released several unofficial forks of GNOME were also developed that kept the traditional desktop traditional, the most notable of these are Cinnamon (forked from GNOME 3) and MATE (forked from GNOME 2).
