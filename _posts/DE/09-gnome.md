### Background
**GNOME** is a GTK+ 3 based desktop environment that is developed as part of the GNU Project. It was founded in the late 1990s, when the Qt widget toolkit that the newly formed KDE desktop was based on, was still proprietary licensed. The developers of GNOME created their own widget toolkit, which became known as the GIMP Toolkit or GTK+ for short, which they released under the GNU GPL.
