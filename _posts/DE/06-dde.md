### Backgrounds
The **Deepin Desktop Environment** (**DDE**) is a desktop environment that uses the Qt5 widget toolkit, although it was once (only a few months ago) based on HTML5 and WebKit with JavaScript extensions. It now also uses the Mutter window manager, which is from GNOME 3. DDE was originally developed for the Chinese Debian (Unstable) and previously Ubuntu-based Linux distribution, deepin. DDE is only available for two Linux distributions that I am aware of &mdash; Arch Linux (thanks to the efforts of Xu Fasheng and Felix Yan) and deepin. I am aware of efforts to port it to Gentoo-based distributions, via the [`gentoo-zh`](https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/gentoo-zh) overlay, but these efforts have since been abandoned.

### Components
* **Display server/window system**: X11.
* **File manager**: GNOME Files (Nautilus).
