### Background
**Cinnamon** is a GNOME 3 fork developed for Linux Mint that is similarly heavy on SRU. It provides a more traditional user interface than GNOME 3, with its appearance more closely resembling that of GNOME 2 than GNOME 3. Compared to the GNOME 2 fork, MATE, that was originally released roughly the same time as it (in 2011 &mdash; the year that GNOME 3 was released), it is significantly more configurable but also heavier on SRU. In fact, I would argue it is even more configurable than its parent, GNOME 3.
