### Background
{% include_relative TE/links.md program="Eclipse" irc="eclipse" link="http://eclipse.org/eclipse" package="dev-util/eclipse-sdk" wiki="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Main_Page" wp="Eclipse_(software)" gw="Eclipse" aw="Eclipse" pacman="extra/x86_64/eclipse" %} is an free and open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) written in Java, that is primarily used for programming in C, C++, Java and PHP, although it is possible to program in other languages (such as Lua, Perl and Python) using it too. These other languages usually require the installation of additional plugins, such as {% include aur.md package="pydev" program="PyDev" %} for Python. It features in-built support for several compilers and interpreters.

### Customizability
I do not have enough experience with Eclipse to make any comment on its customizability, but I do know that extra functionality is usually added using plugins. Many of these plugins are also in the Arch User Repository, but not in any official or unofficial Portage overlays.

### Features
Eclipse features a text editor, in-built support for several compilers and interpreters, it also supports the use of projects.
