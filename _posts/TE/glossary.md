## Glossary
### Command-Line Interface
A [**command-line interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (**CLI**) or **command-line interpreter** is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with their computer by issuing a series of commands. On &#42;nix systems the most common type of CLI are [Unix shells](#unix-shells).

### Fork
In the field of software development a [**fork**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) is when software developers take a copy of a project's source code and start working on it independently of its previous developers. Proprietary software licenses do not usually allow for forks except with the expressed permission of the software's previous developer(s). In the FOSS community forks are common due to the fact that FOSS licenses permit the creation of forks without the previous developer(s)'s permission.

### Graphical User Interface
A [**graphical user interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (**GUI**) is a type of interface that allows users to interact with their computer using graphical icons and visual indicators. This is as opposed to command-line interfaces (CLIs) and textual user interfaces (TUIs), in which users interact with the computer by issuing lines of commands or by writing textual responses to prompts. The most notable type of GUI found on many &#42;nix systems is that of a desktop environment like Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, LXDE, MATE, Xfce, *etc.*

### Integrated Development Environment
An {% include wpb.md name="Integrated Development Environment" %} (**IDE**) is a program that provides users, supposedly comprehensive, facilities for software development. I used the word "*supposedly*", to draw attention to the fact that the definition of comprehensive does vary quite substantially from IDE to IDE. IDEs are almost universally also [text editors](#text-editor), and it is quite often difficult to distinguish the more feature-packed text editors from IDEs. Examples of free and notable IDEs (which, unless otherwise specified, can all be found in the repositories of Manjaro and Sabayon, although not necessarily standard repositories. Some may be in the AUR, while others may be in the Portage Tree but not in the Entropy repositories) include:
* [Bluefish](#bluefish) (its primary focus is on web development and it itself is written in C)
* [Eclipse](#eclipse) (an IDE written in and focused on Java, although it can be used to program in several other languages using free plugins. Recent versions of it are not present in the Portage Tree or Entropy repositories, rather if you want to install it on Sabayon I suggest you download it from http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ and install it by following the instructions there)
* [Geany](#geany) (lightweight and not the most extensive or powerful IDE out there, it is written in C)
* GNU Octave &geq;3.8.0 (focused on the GNU Octave programming language, which itself is mostly concerned with numerical computing. It is written mostly in C, C++ and Fortran)
* [NetBeans](#netbeans) (an IDE that was previously proprietary but is now free and open-source and is written entirely in Java. Its primary focus is on Java, although it also supports JavaScript and a small handful of other languages. It used to support the Python programming, but it does not anymore)
* [PyCharm Community Edition](#pycharm) (an IDE that as its name suggests is focused solely on Python. It is written in Java and is the FOSS version of PyCharm, a more feature-packed proprietary version also exists)
* [Spyder](#spyder) (an IDE that is focused solely on Python, with a particular emphasis on scientific computing. It too is written mostly in Python)

### IDE Features
IDEs possess several features that are supposed to distinguish them from standard TEs, these features include:
* **In-built implementation support**: in other words, the ability to implement (compile or interpret, depending on the programming language) the files being edited or created in the IDE. 
* **Project Views**: this is my way of saying that usually in IDEs you can navigate the contents of a project folder, editing each file therein without having to open up a new IDE window.

### Text Editor
A {% include wpb.md name="Text editor" %} (**TE**) is any program that can be used to edit text files, they are particularly invaluable to computer programmers because they can be used to edit software source code or document markup.
