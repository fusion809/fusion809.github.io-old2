### Background
{% include_relative TE/links2.md program="Eric Python IDE" package="dev-util/eric" pacman="community/any/eric/" link="http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/" wp="Eric_Python_IDE" hr="http://die-offenbachs.homelinux.org:48888/hg/eric/" sf="eric-ide" %} is a free and open-source IDE that is developed by its own community of donation-sponsored developers. It is written in and used to program in Python. As of Eric version 6, it supports both Python 2 and Python 3.

### Customizability
Eric has an extensive in-built plugin system. These plugins can be installed from within Eric's interface by going to "Plugins&rarr;Plugin Repository" and selecting the required plugin. I have limited experience with it so I cannot comment on its customizability.

### Features
Its features include support for managing Mercurial, Subversion and Git repositories, an integrated Python debugger, an interactive embedded Python shell with syntax-highlighting, syntax-highlighting for its text editor component, code autocompletion, *etc.*
