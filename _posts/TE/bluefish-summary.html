<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: &gt;8. Available in the Entropy Store and from Portage</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: &gt;4. Its keyboard shortcuts are intuitive (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy), beyond this my experience with it is not extensive enough for me to comment.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;4. It is customizable, but as I do not have much experience with this text editor, I do not know just how customizable it is.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;7. It is possible to do compiling and use integrated development environment (IDE)-type features.</li>
	<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 2. Fairly little experience with it, as I am not really into web development.</li>
	<li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 5. Bluefish (<a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/bluefish,155845,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">2.2.7</a>) is a 3.1 MB download with Entropy and takes up 9.5 MB HDD space when installed. This is my <code>ps mem</code> table on Sabayon: {% include Code/gist.html id="9605606058969f3532e4" %} while on Manjaro Bluefish 2.2.7 is a 2.5 MB download and takes up 9.2 MB when installed. On Manjaro I got this <code>ps_mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="cd8a29d32bc600a0567e" %}</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: ~7. Cannot be too confident as to this rating without using this text editor more.</li>
