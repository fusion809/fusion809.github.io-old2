  <li><strong>Availability</strong>: 6. Not available in either distribution's official repositories, but can be installed via unofficial channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: 8? Fairly limited experience with it, but it dos not seem to difficult to use. Its keymap is standard (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> for copy) and intuitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &lt;5. From what I can tell, it is not customizable.</li>
  <li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;8.</li>

  <li><strong>SRU</strong>: 4. The source code tarball of CodeLite 9.0 is about 69.5 MiB in size and as neither of these distributions have any binary packages from which CodeLite 9.0 can be installed, I cannot really say its installed size on Sabayon, while on Manjaro its size is 38.5 MiB. Here is my <code>ps_mem</code> table on Manjaro:
<pre>Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used       Program

 2.2 MiB +   2.5 MiB =   4.8 MiB       codelite_indexer
92.6 MiB +   4.3 MiB =  97.0 MiB       codelite
---------------------------------
                       101.7 MiB

  <li><strong>Overall</strong>: 7-8. The fact it only supports these four programming languages is a weakness in my books.</li>
