<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: &gt;8. Readily available for installation on Sabayon.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: &leq;5. Not particularly difficult for a newcomer to use as a basic text editor, but any further usage requires extensive knowledge of ELisp.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;9. Extensively customizable for all those that understand ELisp sufficiently.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;9. It is one of the most feature-packed text editors available today.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: 6. I am actually quite surprised by its lack of popularity on Sabayon, from what I have heard it should have ranked right up there with Vim for popularity.</li>
	<li><strong>SRU</strong>: 7-8. <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/emacs,158951,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">Emacs 24.5</a> is a 35.8 MB download and takes up 142.2 MB HDD space when installed. Fairly lightweight as far as text editors go, RAM-wise. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table:
<pre>
Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	Program

 31.6 MiB +   3.0 MiB =  34.5 MiB	emacs-24
---------------------------------
                         34.5 MiB
=================================
</pre>
while under Manjaro GNU Emacs 24.5 gave this <code>ps_mem</code> table:
<pre> Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	 Program

 25.5 MiB +   2.5 MiB =  28.1 MiB   emacs-24.5
---------------------------------
                         28.1 MiB
=================================
</pre>
</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8. It is a very powerful text editor, but to me, its lack of customizability by those that do not understand ELisp is a significant disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
