  <li><strong>Availability</strong>: 7-8.</li>
  <li><strong>Beginner-Friendliness</strong>: 8. It seems fairly intuitive from my limited experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 8. I have not used it, for anymore than a couple of minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Features</strong>: 8.</li>
  <li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 1-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Popularity</strong>: No data.</li>
  <li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 1-2. The new installer is a 43.6 MB download and when installed Eclipse should take up at least 110 MB (exact figures are not available due)
On Manjaro it (specifically <code>eclipse-common</code>, which is the bare minimum of the IDE) is 108 MB, when installed, download size is 99.5 MB and this is my <code>ps_mem</code> table:
<pre>
  Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used       Program

 3.9 MiB + 764.5 KiB =   4.6 MiB       eclipse
739.6 MiB +   6.3 MiB = 745.9 MiB       java
---------------------------------
                       750.5 MiB

  <li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8. Its high SRU is a significant disadvantage.</li>
