<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: &gt;8. Available in the Entropy Store and from Portage</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: &gt;4. Its keyboard shortcuts are intuitive (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy), behind this my experience with it is not extensive enough for me to comment.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;4. It is customizable, but as I do not have much experience with this text editor, I do not know just how customizable it is.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;7. It is possible to do compiling and use integrated development environment (IDE)-type features.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: 2. It has received one vote on my poll, thus far.</li>
	<li><strong>SRU</strong>: 5. Bluefish (<a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/bluefish,155845,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">2.2.7</a>) is a 3.1 MB download with Entropy and takes up 9.5 MB HDD space when installed. This is my <code>ps mem</code> table:

on Manjaro Linux with version 2.2.7 I got this <code>ps_mem</code> table:
