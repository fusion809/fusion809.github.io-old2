<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 8.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: 8. Fairly beginner-friendly, but extra functionalities beyond that available via existing plugins must be added using self-made scripts.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;8. Very customizabile.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8. Extensive auto-indentation and syntax-highlighting support for a range of computer languages, as has some IDE features.</li>
	<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 2. Not too much experience as it is quite SRU-heavy and is not feature-packed enough to justify me putting up with its SRU.</li>
	<li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 3. <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/jedit,156957,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">jEdit 5.2.0</a> is a 2.6 MB download and takes up 10 MB HDD space when installed. Second heaviest text editor compared in this post, after Atom, RAM-wise. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="fd976335d6931cf964b7" %} jEdit 5.3.0 is a 2.9 download and takes up 29.2 MB when it is installed. It also gave this <code>ps_mem</code> table for jEdit 5.3.0: {% include Code/gist.html id="302b48a141294a5103c6" %}</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8. Seems like quite a useful text editor.</li>
