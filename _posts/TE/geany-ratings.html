<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 7-8. I am rating it a little lower than 8, as the latest version in the Entropy Store is not the latest, even though the latest has been available for three months, thus far.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: 8. It seems fairly user-friendly, as its keyboard shortcuts are fairly intuitive.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 7? My experience with this TE is too limited for me to be confident with this rating.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: 5-7.</li>
	<li><strong>SRU</strong>: 8. <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/geany,126394,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">Geany 1.24.1</a> is a 3.4 MB download and takes up 9.8 MB HDD space when installed. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table (remember I have neglected to include the RAM used by the embedded terminal emulator):
<pre>Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	Program

 18.5 MiB +   3.1 MiB =  21.6 MiB	geany
---------------------------------
                         21.6 MiB
=================================

on Manjaro Linux Geany 1.26 gave this <code>ps_mem</code> table:
<pre> Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	Program

 11.4 MiB +   2.5 MiB =  13.9 MiB	geany
---------------------------------
                         13.9 MiB
