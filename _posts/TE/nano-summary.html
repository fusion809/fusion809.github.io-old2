	<li><abbr title="My Experience With It"><strong>MEWI</strong></abbr>: 8. It is usually the first TE I go to, when I have a small text file I want to edit.</li>
	<li><strong>System Resource Usage</strong>: 10. On Sabayon, <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/nano,163035,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">GNU nano 2.5.0</a> is a 0.6 MB download and takes up 1.8 MB HDD space when installed. It is incredibly light, here is my <code>ps mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="fe0fd56e9edca5050f69" %} on Manjaro Linux, GNU nano 2.5.0 is a ~400 KiB download and takes up 2.1 MiB when installed. It also gave the <code>ps_mem</code> table: {% include Code/gist.html id="81d4c657d36daf22073d" %}</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8. I rather like it for basic editing, but whenever I want to edit a several dozen-line file, or bigger, I usually switch to Atom as it is easier to navigate in Atom, in my experience.</li>
