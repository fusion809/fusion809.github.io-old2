<li>Emerge the package from the Portage Tree. This will get you release 20141029, at best. I have not tried this due to how old a version this package is. To do this simply run:
{% include Code/coder.html line1="emerge games-strategy/openra" %}</li>
<li>{% capture item1 %}Add the `games-overlay` with Layman and emerge the latest version available from it, 20150919. To do this run:
{% include Code/coder.html line1="layman -a games-overlay" line2="emerge --sync && layman -S" line3="emerge games-strategy/openra-20150919::games-overlay" %}{% endcapture %}{{ item1 | markdownify }}</li>
<li>Add the <code><a href="https://github.com/cerebrum/dr" link="_blank">dr</a></code> overlay (not available with Layman) and emerge the latest version, 20150919. This option I have not done, due to the fact it needs freetype unmerged and that would break my system. To do this run:
{% include Code/coder.html line1="layman -o http://github.com/cerebrum/dr/raw/master/repo.xml -f -a dr" line2="emerge --sync && layman -S" line3="emerge games-strategy/openra::dr" %}</li>
<li>{% capture item2 %}Compile the source code yourself and install OpenRA from that (which will get you the latest version of OpenRA, 20150919). This option I have succeeded in doing and is how OpenRA is currently installed on my system. To do this I ran:
{% include Code/codeu.html line1="wget -c https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/archive/release-20150919.tar.gz | tar -xz" line2="cd OpenRA-release-20150919" line3="make dependencies && make all" %}
This does not add an executable of OpenRA to `/usr/games/bin/` and hence running `openra` from the command-line will not start the game. So after this I also created a shell script file called `/usr/games/bin/openra` with nano (that is, I ran{% include Code/coders.html line1="nano /usr/games/bin/openra" %}) with the line `mono --debug /path/to/OpenRA.Game.exe` where `/path/to` is replaced with the path to where you built OpenRA from source code (which for me is `/home/fusion809/Programs/OpenRA-release-20150919`).{% endcapture %}{{ item2 | markdownify }}</li>
