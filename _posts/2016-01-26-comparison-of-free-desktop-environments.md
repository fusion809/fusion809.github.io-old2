Almost all frequently-encountered modern **Linux distributions** (LDs) come with some pre-installed **graphical user interface** (GUI) by which users can interact with their system. The most popular types of GUI used by LDs are **desktop environments** (DEs) and **window managers** (WMs). DEs are by far the most popular GUIs and, by definition, are composed, partly, of WMs too. A precise, attempt at a definition of DEs and WMs, can be found in the [glossary](#glossary) section of this post. As I have mentioned elsewhere on this blog I have tried quite a few LDs and I have also tried quite a few different DEs/WMs, but because of my own technical limitations only a small handful of them I have used enough to confidently review. Notable DEs/WMs include:
* [**Awesome**](#awesome) &mdash; a lightweight and extensively configurable, dynamic window manager that is best suited for advanced users.
* [**Budgie Desktop**](#budgie-desktop) &mdash; a desktop environment used by Solus OS, which resembles the user interface of Chrome OS. It is built on a GNOME 3 base.
* [**Cinnamon**](#cinnamon) &mdash; a GNOME 3 fork with a more traditional user interface that is developed for use as Linux Mint's default desktop.
* [**Deepin Desktop Environment**](#deepin-desktop-environment) (**DDE**) &mdash; a desktop environment developed for Deepin, a Debian and formerly Ubuntu-based Linux distribution originating from China.
* [**Enlightenment**](#enlightenment) &mdash; a feature-packed eye-candy stacking window manager originally developed in the mid 1990s.
* [**Fluxbox**](#fluxbox) &mdash; a lightweight and simple window manager.
* [**GNOME**](#gnome) &mdash; a more complete desktop environment.
