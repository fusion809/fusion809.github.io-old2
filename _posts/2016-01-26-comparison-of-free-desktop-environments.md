The various distributions of Linux have, available to them, over a dozen different desktop environments (DEs) and window managers (WMs). Notable ones include:
* **Awesome** &mdash; a lightweight and extensively configurable window manager that is best suited for advanced users.
* **Budgie Desktop** &mdash; a desktop environment used by Solus OS, which resembles the user interface of Chrome OS. It is built on a GNOME 3 base.
* **Cinnamon** &mdash; a GNOME 3 fork with a more traditional user interface that is developed for use as Linux Mint's default desktop.
