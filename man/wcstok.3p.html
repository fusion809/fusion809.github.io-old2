<h1>NAME</h1> wcstok &#8212; split a wide-character string into tokens</div>

<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;<div class="spacer">

wchar_t *wcstok(wchar_t *restrict <i>ws1</i>, const wchar_t *restrict <i>ws2</i>,<br/>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&#160;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO&#160;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 defers to the ISO&#160;C standard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A sequence of calls to  <i>wcstok</i>() shall break the wide-character string pointed to by <i>ws1</i> into a sequence of tokens, each of which shall be delimited by a wide-character code from the wide-character string pointed to by <i>ws2</i>. The <i>ptr</i> argument points to a caller-provided <b>wchar_t</b> pointer into which the  <i>wcstok</i>() function shall store information necessary for it to continue scanning the same wide-character string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first call in the sequence has <i>ws1</i> as its first argument, and is followed by calls with a null pointer as their first argument. The separator string pointed to by <i>ws2</i> may be different from call to call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first call in the sequence shall search the wide-character string pointed to by <i>ws1</i> for the first wide-character code that is <i>not</i> contained in the current separator string pointed to by <i>ws2</i>. If no such wide-character code is found, then there are no tokens in the wide-character string pointed to by <i>ws1</i> and  <i>wcstok</i>() shall return a null pointer. If such a wide-character code is found, it shall be the start of the first token.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>wcstok</i>() function shall then search from there for a wide-character code that <i>is</i> contained in the current separator string. If no such wide-character code is found, the current token extends to the end of the wide-character string pointed to by <i>ws1</i>, and subsequent searches for a token shall return a null pointer. If such a wide-character code is found, it shall be overwritten by a null wide character, which terminates the current token. The  <i>wcstok</i>() function shall save a pointer to the following wide-character code, from which the next search for a token shall start.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the first argument, shall start searching from the saved pointer and behave as described above.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The implementation shall behave as if no function calls  <i>wcstok</i>().</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, the  <i>wcstok</i>() function shall return a pointer to the first wide-character code of a token. Otherwise, if there is no token,  <i>wcstok</i>() shall return a null pointer.</div>
