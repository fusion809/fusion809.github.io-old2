<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> These files configure various parameters of the systemd login manager,  <b>systemd-logind.service</b>(8).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</h1> Default configuration is defined during compilation, so a configuration file is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. By default the configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. This file can be edited to create local overrides.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install configuration snippets in /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. The main configuration file is read before any of the configuration directories, and has the lowest precedence; entries in a file in any configuration directory override entries in the single configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the subdirectories they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name takes precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> All options are configured in the &quot;[Login]&quot; section:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>NAutoVTs=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Takes a positive integer. Configures how many virtual terminals (VTs) to allocate by default that, when switched to and are previously unused, &quot;autovt&quot; services are automatically spawned on. These services are instantiated from the template unit autovt@.service for the respective VT TTY name, for example, autovt@tty4.service. By default, autovt@.service is linked to getty@.service. In other words, login prompts are started dynamically as the user switches to unused virtual terminals. Hence, this parameter controls how many login &quot;gettys&quot; are available on the VTs. If a VT is already used by some other subsystem (for example, a graphical login), this kind of activation will not be attempted. Note that the VT configured in  <i>ReserveVT=</i> is always subject to this kind of activation, even if it is not one of the VTs configured with the  <i>NAutoVTs=</i> directive. Defaults to 6. When set to 0, automatic spawning of &quot;autovt&quot; services is disabled.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>ReserveVT=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Takes a positive integer. Identifies one virtual terminal that shall unconditionally be reserved for autovt@.service activation (see above). The VT selected with this option will be marked busy unconditionally, so that no other subsystem will allocate it. This functionality is useful to ensure that, regardless of how many VTs are allocated by other subsystems, one login &quot;getty&quot; is always available. Defaults to 6 (in other words, there will always be a &quot;getty&quot; available on Alt-F6.). When set to 0, VT reservation is disabled.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>KillUserProcesses=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Takes a boolean argument. Configures whether the processes of a user should be killed when the user completely logs out (i.e. after the user's last session ended). Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that setting  <i>KillUserProcesses=1</i> will break tools like  <b>screen</b>(1).</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>KillOnlyUsers=</i>, <i>KillExcludeUsers=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
These settings take space-separated lists of usernames that influence the effect of  <i>KillUserProcesses=</i>. If not empty, only processes of users listed in  <i>KillOnlyUsers=</i> will be killed when they log out entirely. Processes of users listed in  <i>KillExcludeUsers=</i> are excluded from being killed.  <i>KillExcludeUsers=</i> defaults to &quot;root&quot; and takes precedence over  <i>KillOnlyUsers=</i>, which defaults to the empty list.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>IdleAction=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Configures the action to take when the system is idle. Takes one of &quot;ignore&quot;, &quot;poweroff&quot;, &quot;reboot&quot;, &quot;halt&quot;, &quot;kexec&quot;, &quot;suspend&quot;, &quot;hibernate&quot;, &quot;hybrid-sleep&quot;, and &quot;lock&quot;. Defaults to &quot;ignore&quot;.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Note that this requires that user sessions correctly report the idle status to the system. The system will execute the action after all sessions report that they are idle, no idle inhibitor lock is active, and subsequently, the time configured with  <i>IdleActionSec=</i> (see below) has expired.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>IdleActionSec=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Configures the delay after which the action configured in  <i>IdleAction=</i> (see above) is taken after the system is idle.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>InhibitDelayMaxSec=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Specifies the maximum time a system shutdown or sleep request is delayed due to an inhibitor lock of type &quot;delay&quot; being active before the inhibitor is ignored and the operation executes anyway. Defaults to 5.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>HandlePowerKey=</i>, <i>HandleSuspendKey=</i>, <i>HandleHibernateKey=</i>, <i>HandleLidSwitch=</i>, <i>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Controls whether logind shall handle the system power and sleep keys and the lid switch to trigger actions such as system power-off or suspend. Can be one of &quot;ignore&quot;, &quot;poweroff&quot;, &quot;reboot&quot;, &quot;halt&quot;, &quot;kexec&quot;, &quot;suspend&quot;, &quot;hibernate&quot;, &quot;hybrid-sleep&quot;, and &quot;lock&quot;. If &quot;ignore&quot;, logind will never handle these keys. If &quot;lock&quot;, all running sessions will be screen-locked; otherwise, the specified action will be taken in the respective event. Only input devices with the &quot;power-switch&quot; udev tag will be watched for key/lid switch events.  <i>HandlePowerKey=</i> defaults to &quot;poweroff&quot;.  <i>HandleSuspendKey=</i> and  <i>HandleLidSwitch=</i> default to &quot;suspend&quot;.  <i>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</i> defaults to &quot;ignore&quot;.  <i>HandleHibernateKey=</i> defaults to &quot;hibernate&quot;. If the system is inserted in a docking station, or if more than one display is connected, the action specified by  <i>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</i> occurs; otherwise the  <i>HandleLidSwitch=</i> action occurs.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>, <i>SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>, <i>HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>, <i>LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Controls whether actions triggered by the power and sleep keys and the lid switch are subject to inhibitor locks. These settings take boolean arguments. If &quot;no&quot;, the inhibitor locks taken by applications in order to block the requested operation are respected. If &quot;yes&quot;, the requested operation is executed in any case.  <i>PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i>,  <i>SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i> and  <i>HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=</i> default to &quot;no&quot;.  <i>LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=</i> defaults to &quot;yes&quot;. This means that the lid switch does not respect suspend blockers by default, but the power and sleep keys do.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>HoldoffTimeoutSec=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Specifies the timeout after system startup or system resume in which systemd will hold off on reacting to LID events. This is required for the system to properly detect any hotplugged devices so systemd can ignore LID events if external monitors, or docks, are connected. If set to 0, systemd will always react immediately, possibly before the kernel fully probed all hotplugged devices. This is safe, as long as you do not care for systemd to account for devices that have been plugged or unplugged while the system was off. Defaults to 30s.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>RuntimeDirectorySize=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Sets the size limit on the  <i>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</i> runtime directory for each user who logs in. Takes a size in bytes, optionally suffixed with the usual K, G, M, and T suffixes, to the base 1024 (IEC). Alternatively, a numerical percentage suffixed by &quot;%&quot; may be specified, which sets the size limit relative to the amount of physical RAM. Defaults to 10%. Note that this size is a safety limit only. As each runtime directory is a tmpfs file system, it will only consume as much memory as is needed.</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>RemoveIPC=</i><div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
Controls whether System V and POSIX IPC objects belonging to the user shall be removed when the user fully logs out. Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, the user may not consume IPC resources after the last of the user's sessions terminated. This covers System V semaphores, shared memory and message queues, as well as POSIX shared memory and message queues. Note that IPC objects of the root user are excluded from the effect of this setting. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.</div>
