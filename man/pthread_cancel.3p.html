<h1>NAME</h1> pthread_cancel &#8212; cancel execution of a thread</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int pthread_cancel(pthread_t <i>thread</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall request that <i>thread</i> be canceled. The target thread's cancelability state and type determines when the cancellation takes effect. When the cancellation is acted on, the cancellation cleanup handlers for <i>thread</i> shall be called. When the last cancellation cleanup handler returns, the thread-specific data destructor functions shall be called for <i>thread</i>. When the last destructor function returns, <i>thread</i> shall be terminated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The cancellation processing in the target thread shall run asynchronously with respect to the calling thread returning from  <i>pthread_cancel</i>().</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If successful, the  <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.<div class="spacer">

<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Two alternative functions were considered for sending the cancellation notification to a thread. One would be to define a new SIGCANCEL signal that had the cancellation semantics when delivered; the other was to define the new  <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function, which would trigger the cancellation semantics.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The advantage of a new signal was that so much of the delivery criteria were identical to that used when trying to deliver a signal that making cancellation notification a signal was seen as consistent. Indeed, many implementations implement cancellation using a special signal. On the other hand, there would be no signal functions that could be used with this signal except  <i>pthread_kill</i>(), and the behavior of the delivered cancellation signal would be unlike any previously existing defined signal.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The benefits of a special function include the recognition that this signal would be defined because of the similar delivery criteria and that this is the only common behavior between a cancellation request and a signal. In addition, the cancellation delivery mechanism does not have to be implemented as a signal. There are also strong, if not stronger, parallels with language exception mechanisms than with signals that are potentially obscured if the delivery mechanism is visibly closer to signals.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the end, it was considered that as there were so many exceptions to the use of the new signal with existing signals functions it would be misleading. A special function has resolved this problem. This function was carefully defined so that an implementation wishing to provide the cancellation functions on top of signals could do so. The special function also means that implementations are not obliged to implement cancellation with signals.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[ESRCH]</b> error.</div>
