<h1>NAME</h1> pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol &#8212; get and set the protocol attribute of the mutex attributes object ( <b>REALTIME THREADS</b>)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol(const pthread_mutexattr_t<br/>
    *restrict <i>attr</i>, int *restrict <i>protocol</i>);<br/>
int pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(pthread_mutexattr_t *<i>attr</i>,<br/>
    int <i>protocol</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() and  <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() functions, respectively, shall get and set the protocol attribute of a mutex attributes object pointed to by <i>attr</i> which was previously created by the function  <i>pthread_mutexattr_init</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>protocol</i> attribute defines the protocol to be followed in utilizing mutexes. The value of <i>protocol</i> may be one of:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT<br/>
PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE<br/>
PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT<br/>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
which are defined in the <i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i> header. The default value of the attribute shall be PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a thread owns a mutex with the PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE <i>protocol</i> attribute, its priority and scheduling shall not be affected by its mutex ownership.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of owning one or more robust mutexes with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT <i>protocol</i> attribute, it shall execute at the higher of its priority or the priority of the highest priority thread waiting on any of the robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this protocol.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of owning one or more non-robust mutexes with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT <i>protocol</i> attribute, it shall execute at the higher of its priority or the priority of the highest priority thread waiting on any of the non-robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this protocol.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a thread owns one or more robust mutexes initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the higher of its priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all the robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute, regardless of whether other threads are blocked on any of these robust mutexes or not.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a thread owns one or more non-robust mutexes initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the higher of its priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all the non-robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this attribute, regardless of whether other threads are blocked on any of these non-robust mutexes or not.<div class="spacer">
</div>
While a thread is holding a mutex which has been initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed, such as by a call to  <i>sched_setparam</i>(). Likewise, when a thread unlocks a mutex that has been initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a thread simultaneously owns several mutexes initialized with different protocols, it shall execute at the highest of the priorities that it would have obtained by each of these protocols.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a thread makes a call to  <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>(), the mutex was initialized with the protocol attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, when the calling thread is blocked because the mutex is owned by another thread, that owner thread shall inherit the priority level of the calling thread as long as it continues to own the mutex. The implementation shall update its execution priority to the maximum of its assigned priority and all its inherited priorities. Furthermore, if this owner thread itself becomes blocked on another mutex with the <i>protocol</i> attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, the same priority inheritance effect shall be propagated to this other owner thread, in a recursive manner.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i> argument to  <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() or  <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, the  <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() and  <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOTSUP</b></dt>
<dd>
The value specified by <i>protocol</i> is an unsupported value.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() and  <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() functions may fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The value specified by <i>protocol</i> is invalid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPERM</b></dt>
<dd>
The caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.<div class="spacer">

<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i> argument to  <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() or  <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</div>
