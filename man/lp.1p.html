<h1>NAME</h1> lp &#8212; send files to a printer</div>

<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
lp <b>[</b>&#8722;c<b>] [</b>&#8722;d <i>dest</i><b>] [</b>&#8722;n <i>copies</i><b>] [</b>&#8722;msw<b>] [</b>&#8722;o <i>option</i><b>]</b>... <b>[</b>&#8722;t <i>title</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The <i>lp</i> utility shall copy the input files to an output destination in an unspecified manner. The default output destination should be to a hardcopy device, such as a printer or microfilm recorder, that produces non-volatile, human-readable documents. If such a device is not available to the application, or if the system provides no such device, the <i>lp</i> utility shall exit with a non-zero exit status.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The actual writing to the output device may occur some time after the <i>lp</i> utility successfully exits. During the portion of the writing that corresponds to each input file, the implementation shall guarantee exclusive access to the device.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>lp</i> utility shall associate a unique <i>request ID</i> with each request.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Normally, a banner page is produced to separate and identify each print job. This page may be suppressed by implementation-defined conditions, such as an operator command or one of the <b>&#8722;o</b> <i>option</i> values.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The <i>lp</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;c</b></dt>
<dd>
Exit only after further access to any of the input files is no longer required. The application can then safely delete or modify the files without affecting the output operation. Normally, files are not copied, but are linked whenever possible. If the <b>&#8722;c</b> option is not given, then the user should be careful not to remove any of the files before the request has been printed in its entirety. It should also be noted that in the absence of the <b>&#8722;c</b> option, any changes made to the named files after the request is made but before it is printed may be reflected in the printed output. On some implementations, <b>&#8722;c</b> may be on by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;d&#160;</b><i>dest</i></dt>
<dd>
Specify a string that names the destination (<i>dest</i>). If <i>dest</i> is a printer, the request shall be printed only on that specific printer. If <i>dest</i> is a class of printers, the request shall be printed on the first available printer that is a member of the class. Under certain conditions (printer unavailability, file space limitation, and so on), requests for specific destinations need not be accepted. Destination names vary between systems.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 10.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>&#8722;d</b> is not specified, and neither the <i>LPDEST</i> nor <i>PRINTER</i> environment variable is set, an unspecified destination is used. The <b>&#8722;d</b> <i>dest</i> option shall take precedence over <i>LPDEST</i>, which in turn shall take precedence over <i>PRINTER</i>. Results are undefined when <i>dest</i> contains a value that is not a valid destination name.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;m</b></dt>
<dd>
Send mail (see <i><i>mailx</i></i>) after the files have been printed. By default, no mail is sent upon normal completion of the print request.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;n&#160;</b><i>copies</i></dt>
<dd>
Write <i>copies</i> number of copies of the files, where <i>copies</i> is a positive decimal integer. The methods for producing multiple copies and for arranging the multiple copies when multiple <i>file</i> operands are used are unspecified, except that each file shall be output as an integral whole, not interleaved with portions of other files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;o&#160;</b><i>option</i></dt>
<dd>
Specify printer-dependent or class-dependent <i>option</i>s. Several such <i>option</i>s may be collected by specifying the <b>&#8722;o</b> option more than once.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>
Write <i>title</i> on the banner page of the output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;w</b></dt>
<dd>
Write a message on the user's terminal after the files have been printed. If the user is not logged in, then mail shall be sent instead.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPERANDS</h1> The following operand shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<i>file</i></dt>
<dd>
A pathname of a file to be output. If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'&#8722;'</b>, the standard input shall be used.

</div>
A conforming application can use one of the <i>file</i> operands only with the <b>&#8722;c</b> option or if the file is publicly readable and guaranteed to be available at the time of printing. This is because POSIX.1&#8208;2008 gives the implementation the freedom to queue up the request for printing at some later time by a different process that might not be able to access the file.</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The <i>lp</i> utility was designed to be a basic version of a utility that is already available in many historical implementations. The standard developers considered that it should be implementable simply as:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>cat &quot;$@&quot; &gt; /dev/lp</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
after appropriate processing of options, if that is how the implementation chose to do it and if exclusive access could be granted (so that two users did not write to the device simultaneously). Although in the future the standard developers may add other options to this utility, it should always be able to execute with no options or operands and send the standard input to an unspecified output device.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 makes no representations concerning the format of the printed output, except that it must be ``human-readable'' and ``non-volatile''. Thus, writing by default to a disk or tape drive or a display terminal would not qualify. (Such destinations are not prohibited when <b>&#8722;d</b> <i>dest</i>, <i>LPDEST</i>, or <i>PRINTER</i> are used, however.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 is worded such that a ``print job'' consisting of multiple input files, possibly in multiple copies, is guaranteed to print so that any one file is not intermixed with another, but there is no statement that all the files or copies have to print out together.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>&#8722;c</b> option may imply a spooling operation, but this is not required. The utility can be implemented to wait until the printer is ready and then wait until it is finished. Because of that, there is no attempt to define a queuing mechanism (priorities, classes of output, and so on).<div class="spacer">
</div>
On some historical systems, the request ID reported on the STDOUT can be used to later cancel or find the status of a request using utilities not defined in this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Although the historical System V <i>lp</i> and BSD <i>lpr</i> utilities have provided similar functionality, they used different names for the environment variable specifying the destination printer. Since the name of the utility here is <i>lp</i>, <i>LPDEST</i> (used by the System V <i>lp</i> utility) was given precedence over <i>PRINTER</i> (used by the BSD <i>lpr</i> utility). Since environments of users frequently contain one or the other environment variable, the <i>lp</i> utility is required to recognize both. If this was not done, many applications would send output to unexpected output devices when users moved from system to system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some have commented that <i>lp</i> has far too little functionality to make it worthwhile. Requests have proposed additional options or operands or both that added functionality. The requests included:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Wording <i>requiring</i> the output to be ``hardcopy''</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A requirement for multiple printers</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Options for supporting various page-description languages</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Given that a compliant system is not required to even have a printer, placing further restrictions upon the behavior of the printer is not useful. Since hardcopy format is so application-dependent, it is difficult, if not impossible, to select a reasonable subset of functionality that should be required on all compliant systems.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The term <i>unspecified</i> is used in this section in lieu of  <i>implementation-defined</i> as most known implementations would not be able to make definitive statements in their conformance documents; the existence and usage of printers is very dependent on how the system administrator configures each individual system.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since the default destination, device type, queuing mechanisms, and acceptable forms of input are all unspecified, usage guidelines for what a conforming application can do are as follows:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Use the command in a pipeline, or with <b>&#8722;c</b>, so that there are no permission problems and the files can be safely deleted or modified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Limit output to text files of reasonable line lengths and printable characters and include no device-specific formatting information, such as a page description language. The meaning of ``reasonable'' in this context can only be answered as a quality-of-implementation issue, but it should be apparent from historical usage patterns in the industry and the locale. The <i>pr</i> and <i>fold</i> utilities can be used to achieve reasonable formatting for the default page size of the implementation.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Alternatively, the application can arrange its installation in such a way that it requires the system administrator or operator to provide the appropriate information on <i>lp</i> options and environment variable values.<div class="spacer">
</div>
At a minimum, having this utility in this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 tells the industry that conforming applications require a means to print output and provides at least a command name and <i>LPDEST</i> routing mechanism that can be used for discussions between vendors, application developers, and users. The use of ``should'' in the DESCRIPTION of <i>lp</i> clearly shows the intent of the standard developers, even if they cannot mandate that all systems (such as laptops) have printers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 does not specify what the ownership of the process performing the writing to the output device may be. If <b>&#8722;c</b> is not used, it is unspecified whether the process performing the writing to the output device has permission to read <i>file</i> if there are any restrictions in place on who may read <i>file</i> until after it is printed. Also, if <b>&#8722;c</b> is not used, the results of deleting <i>file</i> before it is printed are unspecified.</div>
