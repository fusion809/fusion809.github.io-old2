<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This command treats its arguments as the specification of one or more subprocesses to execute. The arguments take the form of a standard shell pipeline where each  <i>arg</i> becomes one word of a command, and each distinct command becomes a subprocess.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the initial arguments to <b>exec</b> start with <b>-</b> then they are treated as command-line switches and are not part of the pipeline specification.  The following switches are currently supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>-ignorestderr</b></dt>
<dd>
Stops the <b>exec</b> command from treating the output of messages to the pipeline's standard error channel as an error case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-keepnewline</b></dt>
<dd>
Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline's output. Normally a trailing newline will be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--</b></dt>
<dd>
Marks the end of switches.  The argument following this one will be treated as the first  <i>arg</i> even if it starts with a <b>-</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If an <i>arg</i> (or pair of <i>arg</i>s) has one of the forms described below then it is used by  <b>exec</b> to control the flow of input and output among the subprocess(es). Such arguments will not be passed to the subprocess(es).  In forms such as &#8220; <b>&lt;</b> <i>fileName</i>&#8221;,  <i>fileName</i> may either be in a separate argument from &#8220; <b>&lt;</b>&#8221; or in the same argument with no intervening space (i.e. &#8220; <b>&lt;</b><i>fileName</i>&#8221;).<dl>
<dt>
<b>|</b></dt>
<dd>
Separates distinct commands in the pipeline.  The standard output of the preceding command will be piped into the standard input of the next command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>|&amp;</b></dt>
<dd>
Separates distinct commands in the pipeline.  Both standard output and standard error of the preceding command will be piped into the standard input of the next command. This form of redirection overrides forms such as 2&gt; and &gt;&amp;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;&#8194;</b><i>fileName</i></dt>
<dd>
The file named by <i>fileName</i> is opened and used as the standard input for the first command in the pipeline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;@&#8194;</b><i>fileId</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previous call to  <b>open</b>. It is used as the standard input for the first command in the pipeline.  <i>FileId</i> must have been opened for reading.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&lt;&lt;&#8194;</b><i>value</i></dt>

Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file named  <i>fileName</i>, overwriting its previous contents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>2&gt;&#8194;</b><i>fileName</i></dt>

Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the file named  <i>fileName</i>, overwriting its previous contents.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&gt;&gt;&#8194;</b><i>fileName</i></dt>

Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file named  <i>fileName</i>, appending to it rather than overwriting it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>2&gt;&gt;&#8194;</b><i>fileName</i></dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&gt;@&#8194;</b><i>fileId</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previous call to  <b>open</b>. Standard output from the last command is redirected to  <i>fileId</i>'s file, which must have been opened for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>2&gt;@&#8194;</b><i>fileId</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previous call to  <b>open</b>. Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to  <i>fileId</i>'s file. The file must have been opened for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>2&gt;@1&#8194;</b></dt>
<dd>
Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the command result.  This operator is only valid at the end of the command pipeline.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&gt;&amp;@&#8194;</b><i>fileId</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return value from a previous call to  <b>open</b>. Both standard output from the last command and standard error from all commands are redirected to  <i>fileId</i>'s file. The file must have been opened for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If standard output has not been redirected then the <b>exec</b> command returns the standard output from the last command in the pipeline, unless &#8220;2&gt;@1&#8221; was specified, in which case standard error is included as well. If any of the commands in the pipeline exit abnormally or are killed or suspended, then  <b>exec</b> will return an error and the error message will include the pipeline's output followed by error messages describing the abnormal terminations; the  <b>-errorcode</b> return option will contain additional information about the last abnormal termination encountered. If any of the commands writes to its standard error file and that standard error is not redirected and  <b>-ignorestderr</b> is not specified, then  <b>exec</b> will return an error;  the error message will include the pipeline's standard output, followed by messages about abnormal terminations (if any), followed by the standard error output.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the last character of the result or error message is a newline then that character is normally deleted from the result or error message. This is consistent with other Tcl return values, which do not normally end with newlines. However, if  <b>-keepnewline</b> is specified then the trailing newline is retained.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If standard input is not redirected with &#8220;&lt;&#8221;, &#8220;&lt;&lt;&#8221; or &#8220;&lt;@&#8221; then the standard input for the first command in the pipeline is taken from the application's current standard input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the last <i>arg</i> is &#8220;&amp;&#8221; then the pipeline will be executed in background. In this case the  <b>exec</b> command will return a list whose elements are the process identifiers for all of the subprocesses in the pipeline. The standard output from the last command in the pipeline will go to the application's standard output if it has not been redirected, and error output from all of the commands in the pipeline will go to the application's standard error file unless redirected.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first word in each command is taken as the command name; tilde-substitution is performed on it, and if the result contains no slashes then the directories in the PATH environment variable are searched for an executable by the given name. If the name contains a slash then it must refer to an executable reachable from the current directory. No &#8220;glob&#8221; expansion or other shell-like substitutions are performed on the arguments to commands.</div>

<h1>PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>Windows</b> (all versions)</dt>
<dd>
Reading from or writing to a socket, using the &#8220; <b>@&#8194;</b><i>fileId</i>&#8221; notation, does not work.  When reading from a socket, a 16-bit DOS application will hang and a 32-bit application will return immediately with end-of-file.  When either type of application writes to a socket, the information is instead sent to the console, if one is present, or is discarded.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The Tk console text widget does not provide real standard IO capabilities. Under Tk, when redirecting from standard input, all applications will see an immediate end-of-file; information redirected to standard output or standard error will be discarded.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Either forward or backward slashes are accepted as path separators for arguments to Tcl commands.  When executing an application, the path name specified for the application may also contain forward or backward slashes as path separators.  Bear in mind, however, that most Windows applications accept arguments with forward slashes only as option delimiters and backslashes only in paths.  Any arguments to an application that specify a path name with forward slashes will not automatically be converted to use the backslash character.  If an argument contains forward slashes as the path separator, it may or may not be recognized as a path name, depending on the program.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Additionally, when calling a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.X application, all path names must use the short, cryptic, path format (e.g., using &#8220;applba~1.def&#8221; instead of &#8220;applbakery.default&#8221;), which can be obtained with the &#8220; <b>file attributes </b><i>fileName </i><b>-shortname</b>&#8221; command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer to a network path.  For example, a simple concatenation of the root directory  <b>c:/</b> with a subdirectory <b>/windows/system</b> will yield  <b>c://windows/system</b> (two slashes together), which refers to the mount point called  <b>system</b> on the machine called <b>windows</b> (and the  <b>c:/</b> is ignored), and is not equivalent to <b>c:/windows/system</b>, which describes a directory on the current computer.  The  <b>file join</b> command should be used to concatenate path components.<div class="spacer">

Note that there are two general types of Win32 console applications:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
[1]</dt>
<dd>
CLI &#8212; CommandLine Interface, simple stdio exchange. <b>netstat.exe</b> for example.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[2]</dt>
<dd>
TUI &#8212; Textmode User Interface, any application that accesses the console API for doing such things as cursor movement, setting text color, detecting key presses and mouse movement, etc.  An example would be  <b>telnet.exe</b> from Windows 2000.  These types of applications are not common in a windows environment, but do exist.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>exec</b> will not work well with TUI applications when a console is not present, as is done when launching applications under wish.  It is desirable to have console applications hidden and detached.  This is a designed-in limitation as  <b>exec</b> wants to communicate over pipes.  The Expect extension addresses this issue when communicating with a TUI application.</div>

Once a 16-bit DOS application has read standard input from a console and then quit, all subsequently run 16-bit DOS applications will see the standard input as already closed.  32-bit applications do not have this problem and will run correctly, even after a 16-bit DOS application thinks that standard input is closed.  There is no known workaround for this bug at this time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Redirection between the <b>NUL:</b> device and a 16-bit application does not always work.  When redirecting from  <b>NUL:</b>, some applications may hang, others will get an infinite stream of &#8220;0x01&#8221; bytes, and some will actually correctly get an immediate end-of-file; the behavior seems to depend upon something compiled into the application itself.  When redirecting greater than 4K or so to  <b>NUL:</b>, some applications will hang.  The above problems do not happen with 32-bit applications.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All DOS 16-bit applications are run synchronously.  All standard input from a pipe to a 16-bit DOS application is collected into a temporary file; the other end of the pipe must be closed before the 16-bit DOS application begins executing.  All standard output or error from a 16-bit DOS application to a pipe is collected into temporary files; the application must terminate before the temporary files are redirected to the next stage of the pipeline.  This is due to a workaround for a Windows 95 bug in the implementation of pipes, and is how the standard Windows 95 DOS shell handles pipes itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Certain applications, such as <b>command.com</b>, should not be executed interactively.  Applications which directly access the console window, rather than reading from their standard input and writing to their standard output may fail, hang Tcl, or even hang the system if their own private console window is not available to them.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Unix</b>&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;</dt>
<dd>
The <b>exec</b> command is fully functional and works as described.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>UNIX EXAMPLES</h1> Here are some examples of the use of the  <b>exec</b> command on Unix.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To execute a simple program and get its result:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>exec</b> uname -a<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To execute a program that can return a non-zero result, you should wrap the call to  <b>exec</b> in <b>catch</b> and check the contents of the  <b>-errorcode</b> return option if you have an error:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
set status 0<br/>
if {[catch {<b>exec</b> grep foo bar.txt} results options]} {<br/>
   set details [dict get $options -errorcode]<br/>
   if {[lindex $details 0] eq &quot;CHILDSTATUS&quot;} {<br/>
      set status [lindex $details 2]<br/>
   } else {<br/>
      # Some kind of unexpected failure<br/>
   }<br/>
}<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When translating a command from a Unix shell invocation, care should be taken over the fact that single quote characters have no special significance to Tcl.  Thus:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' numbers.list<br/>
</div>
would be translated into something like:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>exec</b> awk {{sum += $1} END {print sum}} numbers.list<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If you are converting invocations involving shell globbing, you should remember that Tcl does not handle globbing or expand things into multiple arguments by default.  Instead you should write things like this:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>exec</b> ls -l {*}[glob *.tcl]<br/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>WINDOWS EXAMPLES</h1> Here are some examples of the use of the  <b>exec</b> command on Windows.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To start an instance of <i>notepad</i> editing a file without waiting for the user to finish editing the file:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>exec</b> notepad myfile.txt &amp;<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To print a text file using <i>notepad</i>:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>exec</b> notepad /p myfile.txt<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a program calls other programs, such as is common with compilers, then you may need to resort to batch files to hide the console windows that sometimes pop up:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>exec</b> cmp.bat somefile.c -o somefile<br/>
</div>
With the file <i>cmp.bat</i> looking something like:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
@gcc %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Sometimes you need to be careful, as different programs may have the same name and be in the path. It can then happen that typing a command at the DOS prompt finds  <i>a different program</i> than the same command run via  <b>exec</b>. This is because of the (documented) differences in behaviour between  <b>exec</b> and DOS batch files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When in doubt, use the command <b>auto_execok</b>: it will return the complete path to the program as seen by the  <b>exec</b> command.  This applies especially when you want to run &#8220;internal&#8221; commands like  <i>dir</i> from a Tcl script (if you just want to list filenames, use the  <b>glob</b> command.)  To do that, use this:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
<b>exec</b> {*}[auto_execok dir] *.tcl<br/>
</div>
