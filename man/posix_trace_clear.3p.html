<h1>NAME</h1> posix_trace_clear &#8212; clear trace stream and trace log ( <b>TRACING</b>)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br/>
#include &lt;trace.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int posix_trace_clear(trace_id_t <i>trid</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function shall reinitialize the trace stream identified by the argument <i>trid</i> as if it were returning from the  <i>posix_trace_create</i>() function, except that the same allocated resources shall be reused, the mapping of trace event type identifiers to trace event names shall be unchanged, and the trace stream status shall remain unchanged (that is, if it was running, it remains running and if it was suspended, it remains suspended).<div class="spacer">
</div>
All trace events in the trace stream recorded before the call to  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() shall be lost. The <i>posix_stream_full_status</i> status shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no guarantee that all trace events that occurred during the  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() call are recorded; the behavior with respect to trace points that may occur during this call is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the Trace Log option is supported and the trace stream has been created with a log, the  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function shall reinitialize the trace stream with the same behavior as if the trace stream was created without the log, plus it shall reinitialize the trace log associated with the trace stream identified by the argument <i>trid</i> as if it were returning from the  <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>() function, except that the same allocated resources, for the trace log, may be reused and the associated trace stream status remains unchanged. The first trace event recorded in the trace log after the call to  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() shall be the same as the first trace event recorded in the active trace stream after the call to  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>(). The <i>posix_log_full_status</i> status shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no guarantee that all trace events that occurred during the  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() call are recorded in the trace log; the behavior with respect to trace points that may occur during this call is unspecified. If the log full policy is POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the effect of a call to this function is unspecified for the trace log associated with the trace stream identified by the <i>trid</i> argument.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, the  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall return the corresponding error number.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The value of the <i>trid</i> argument does not correspond to an active trace stream.</dd>
</dl>
