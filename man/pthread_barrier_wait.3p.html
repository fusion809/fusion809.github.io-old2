<h1>NAME</h1> pthread_barrier_wait &#8212; synchronize at a barrier</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int pthread_barrier_wait(pthread_barrier_t *<i>barrier</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() function shall synchronize participating threads at the barrier referenced by <i>barrier</i>. The calling thread shall block until the required number of threads have called  <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() specifying the barrier.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the required number of threads have called  <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() specifying the barrier, the constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD shall be returned to one unspecified thread and zero shall be returned to each of the remaining threads. At this point, the barrier shall be reset to the state it had as a result of the most recent  <i>pthread_barrier_init</i>() function that referenced it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD is defined in <i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i> and its value shall be distinct from any other value returned by  <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized barrier.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a signal is delivered to a thread blocked on a barrier, upon return from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting at the barrier if the barrier wait has not completed (that is, if the required number of threads have not arrived at the barrier during the execution of the signal handler); otherwise, the thread shall continue as normal from the completed barrier wait. Until the thread in the signal handler returns from it, it is unspecified whether other threads may proceed past the barrier once they have all reached it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A thread that has blocked on a barrier shall not prevent any unblocked thread that is eligible to use the same processing resources from eventually making forward progress in its execution. Eligibility for processing resources shall be determined by the scheduling policy.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, the  <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() function shall return PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD for a single (arbitrary) thread synchronized at the barrier and zero for each of the other threads. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Applications using this function may be subject to priority inversion, as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, <i>Section 3.287</i>, <i>Priority Inversion</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>barrier</i> argument to  <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() does not refer to an initialized barrier object, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h1> None.</div>
