<h1>NAME</h1> flock - apply or remove an advisory lock on an open file</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;sys/file.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>int flock(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, int </b><i>operation</i><b>);</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> Apply or remove an advisory lock on the open file specified by <i>fd</i>. The argument <i>operation</i> is one of the following:<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LOCK_SH</b></dt>
<dd>
Place a shared lock. More than one process may hold a shared lock for a given file at a given time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LOCK_EX</b></dt>
<dd>
Place an exclusive lock. Only one process may hold an exclusive lock for a given file at a given time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LOCK_UN</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove an existing lock held by this process.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
A call to <b>flock</b>() may block if an incompatible lock is held by another process. To make a nonblocking request, include <b>LOCK_NB</b> (by ORing) with any of the above operations.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A single file may not simultaneously have both shared and exclusive locks.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are associated with an open file description (see <b>open</b>(2)). This means that duplicate file descriptors (created by, for example, <b>fork</b>(2) or <b>dup</b>(2)) refer to the same lock, and this lock may be modified or released using any of these descriptors. Furthermore, the lock is released either by an explicit <b>LOCK_UN</b> operation on any of these duplicate descriptors, or when all such descriptors have been closed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a process uses <b>open</b>(2) (or similar) to obtain more than one descriptor for the same file, these descriptors are treated independently by <b>flock</b>(). An attempt to lock the file using one of these file descriptors may be denied by a lock that the calling process has already placed via another descriptor.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A process may hold only one type of lock (shared or exclusive) on a file. Subsequent <b>flock</b>() calls on an already locked file will convert an existing lock to the new lock mode.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A shared or exclusive lock can be placed on a file regardless of the mode in which the file was opened.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>EBADF</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> is not an open file descriptor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINTR</b></dt>
<dd>
While waiting to acquire a lock, the call was interrupted by delivery of a signal caught by a handler; see <b>signal</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>operation</i> is invalid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOLCK</b></dt>
<dd>
The kernel ran out of memory for allocating lock records.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EWOULDBLOCK</b></dt>
<dd>
The file is locked and the <b>LOCK_NB</b> flag was selected.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> 4.4BSD (the <b>flock</b>() call first appeared in 4.2BSD). A version of <b>flock</b>(), possibly implemented in terms of <b>fcntl</b>(2), appears on most UNIX systems.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Since kernel 2.0, <b>flock</b>() is implemented as a system call in its own right rather than being emulated in the GNU C library as a call to <b>fcntl</b>(2). With this implementation, there is no interaction between the types of lock placed by <b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2), and <b>flock</b>() does not detect deadlock. (Note, however, that on some systems, such as the modern BSDs, <b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2) locks <i>do</i> interact with one another.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
In Linux kernels up to 2.6.11, <b>flock</b>() does not lock files over NFS (i.e., the scope of locks was limited to the local system). Instead, one could use <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte-range locking, which does work over NFS, given a sufficiently recent version of Linux and a server which supports locking. Since Linux 2.6.12, NFS clients support <b>flock</b>() locks by emulating them as byte-range locks on the entire file. This means that <b>fcntl</b>(2) and <b>flock</b>() locks <i>do</i> interact with one another over NFS. Since Linux 2.6.37, the kernel supports a compatibility mode that allows <b>flock</b>() locks (and also <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte region locks) to be treated as local; see the discussion of the <i>local_lock</i> option in <b>nfs</b>(5).<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>flock</b>() places advisory locks only; given suitable permissions on a file, a process is free to ignore the use of <b>flock</b>() and perform I/O on the file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2) locks have different semantics with respect to forked processes and <b>dup</b>(2). On systems that implement <b>flock</b>() using <b>fcntl</b>(2), the semantics of <b>flock</b>() will be different from those described in this manual page.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Converting a lock (shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not guaranteed to be atomic: the existing lock is first removed, and then a new lock is established. Between these two steps, a pending lock request by another process may be granted, with the result that the conversion either blocks, or fails if <b>LOCK_NB</b> was specified. (This is the original BSD behavior, and occurs on many other implementations.)</div>
