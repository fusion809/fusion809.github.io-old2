<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b>
scans a temporary build tree (debian/tmp by default) looking
for libraries and generates a <i>symbols</i> file describing
them. This file, if non-empty, is then installed in the
DEBIAN subdirectory of the build tree so that it ends up
included in the control information of the package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When generating
those files, it uses as input some symbols files provided by
the maintainer. It looks for the following files (and uses
the first that is found):</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
interest of those files is to provide the minimal version
associated to each symbol provided by the libraries. Usually
it corresponds to the first version of that package that
provided the symbol, but it can be manually incremented by
the maintainer if the ABI of the symbol is extended without
breaking backwards compatibility. It&rsquo;s the
responsibility of the maintainer to keep those files
up-to-date and accurate, but <b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b>
helps with that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
generated symbols files differ from the maintainer supplied
one, <b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> will print a diff between
the two versions. Furthermore if the difference is too
significant, it will even fail (you can customize how much
difference you can tolerate, see the <b>&minus;c</b>
option).</p>

<h2>MAINTAINING SYMBOLS FILES
<a name="MAINTAINING SYMBOLS FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The symbols
files are really useful only if they reflect the evolution
of the package through several releases. Thus the maintainer
has to update them every time that a new symbol is added so
that its associated minimal version matches reality. The
diffs contained in the build logs can be used as a starting
point, but the maintainer, additionally, has to make sure
that the behaviour of those symbols has not changed in a way
that would make anything using those symbols and linking
against the new version, stop working with the old version.
In most cases, the diff applies directly to the
debian/<i>package</i>.symbols file. That said, further
tweaks are usually needed: it&rsquo;s recommended for
example to drop the Debian revision from the minimal version
so that backports with a lower version number but the same
upstream version still satisfy the generated dependencies.
If the Debian revision can&rsquo;t be dropped because the
symbol really got added by the Debian specific change, then
one should suffix the version with &quot;~&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before applying
any patch to the symbols file, the maintainer should
double-check that it&rsquo;s sane. Public symbols are not
supposed to disappear, so the patch should ideally only add
new lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can put comments in symbols files: any line with
&rsquo;#&rsquo; as the first character is a comment except
if it starts with &rsquo;#include&rsquo; (see section
<b>Using includes</b>). Lines starting with
&rsquo;#MISSING:&rsquo; are special comments documenting
symbols that have disappeared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do not forget
to check if old symbol versions need to be increased. There
is no way <b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> can warn about this.
Blindly applying the diff or assuming there is nothing to
change if there is no diff, without checking for such
changes, can lead to packages with loose dependencies that
claim they can work with older packages they cannot work
with. This will introduce hard to find bugs with (partial)
upgrades.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
#PACKAGE# substitution</b> <br>
In some rare cases, the name of the library varies between
architectures. To avoid hardcoding the name of the package
in the symbols file, you can use the marker
<i>#PACKAGE#</i>. It will be replaced by the real package
name during installation of the symbols files. Contrary to
the <i>#MINVER#</i> marker, <i>#PACKAGE#</i> will never
appear in a symbols file inside a binary package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using symbol
tags</b> <br>
Symbol tagging is useful for marking symbols that are
special in some way. Any symbol can have an arbitrary number
of tags associated with it. While all tags are parsed and
stored, only some of them are understood by
<b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> and trigger special handling of
the symbols. See subsection <b>Standard symbol tags</b> for
reference of these tags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tag
specification comes right before the symbol name (no
whitespace is allowed in between). It always starts with an
opening bracket <b>(</b>, ends with a closing bracket
<b>)</b> and must contain at least one tag. Multiple tags
are separated by the <b>|</b> character. Each tag can
optionally have a value which is separated form the tag name
by the <b>=</b> character. Tag names and values can be
arbitrary strings except they cannot contain any of the
special <b>) | =</b> characters. Symbol names following a
tag specification can optionally be quoted with either
<b>&rsquo;</b> or <b>&quot;</b> characters to allow
whitespaces in them. However, if there are no tags specified
for the symbol, quotes are treated as part of the symbol
name which continues up until the first space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(tag1=i am
marked|tag name with space)&quot;tagged quoted
symbol&quot;@Base 1.0 <br>
(optional)tagged_unquoted_symbol@Base 1.0 1 <br>
untagged_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
symbol in the example is named <i>tagged quoted symbol</i>
and has two tags: <i>tag1</i> with value <i>i am marked</i>
and <i>tag name with space</i> that has no value. The second
symbol named <i>tagged_unquoted_symbol</i> is only tagged
with the tag named <i>optional</i>. The last symbol is an
example of the normal untagged symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since symbol
tags are an extension of the <b>deb&minus;symbols</b>(5)
format, they can only be part of the symbols files used in
source packages (those files should then be seen as
templates used to build the symbols files that are embedded
in binary packages). When <b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> is
called without the <b>&minus;t</b> option, it will output
symbols files compatible to the <b>deb&minus;symbols</b>(5)
format: it fully processes symbols according to the
requirements of their standard tags and strips all tags from
the output. On the contrary, in template mode
(<b>&minus;t</b>) all symbols and their tags (both standard
and unknown ones) are kept in the output and are written in
their original form as they were loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Standard
symbol tags <br>
optional</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A symbol marked as optional can
disappear from the library at any time and that will never
cause <b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> to fail. However,
disappeared optional symbols will continuously appear as
MISSING in the diff in each new package revision. This
behaviour serves as a reminder for the maintainer that such
a symbol needs to be removed from the symbol file or readded
to the library. When the optional symbol, which was
previously declared as MISSING, suddenly reappears in the
next revision, it will be upgraded back to the
&quot;existing&quot; status with its minimum version
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This tag is
useful for symbols which are private where their
disappearance do not cause ABI breakage. For example, most
of C++ template instantiations fall into this category. Like
any other tag, this one may also have an arbitrary value: it
could be used to indicate why the symbol is considered
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>arch=</b><i>architecture
list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This tag allows one to restrict
the set of architectures where the symbol is supposed to
exist. When the symbols list is updated with the symbols
discovered in the library, all arch-specific symbols which
do not concern the current host architecture are treated as
if they did not exist. If an arch-specific symbol matching
the current host architecture does not exist in the library,
normal procedures for missing symbols apply and it may cause
<b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> to fail. On the other hand, if
the arch-specific symbol is found when it was not supposed
to exist (because the current host architecture is not
listed in the tag), it is made arch neutral (i.e. the arch
tag is dropped and the symbol will appear in the diff due to
this change), but it is not considered as new.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When operating
in the default non-template mode, among arch-specific
symbols only those that match the current host architecture
are written to the symbols file. On the contrary, all
arch-specific symbols (including those from foreign arches)
are always written to the symbol file when operating in
template mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
<i>architecture list</i> is the same as the one used in the
<b>Build&minus;Depends</b> field of <i>debian/control</i>
(except the enclosing square brackets []). For example, the
first symbol from the list below will be considered only on
alpha, any&minus;amd64 and ia64 architectures, the second
only on linux architectures, while the third one anywhere
except on armel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">(arch=alpha
any&minus;amd64 ia64)a_64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0 <br>
(arch=linux&minus;any)linux_specific_symbol@Base 1.0 <br>
(arch=!armel)symbol_armel_does_not_have@Base 1.0</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ignore&minus;blacklist</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">dpkg&minus;gensymbols has an
internal blacklist of symbols that should not appear in
symbols files as they are usually only side-effects of
implementation details of the toolchain. If for some reason,
you really want one of those symbols to be included in the
symbols file, you should tag the symbol with
<b>ignore&minus;blacklist</b>. It can be necessary for some
low level toolchain libraries like libgcc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using symbol
patterns</b> <br>
Unlike a standard symbol specification, a pattern may cover
multiple real symbols from the library.
<b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> will attempt to match each
pattern against each real symbol that does <i>not</i> have a
specific symbol counterpart defined in the symbol file.
Whenever the first matching pattern is found, all its tags
and properties will be used as a basis specification of the
symbol. If none of the patterns matches, the symbol will be
considered as new.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pattern is
considered lost if it does not match any symbol in the
library. By default this will trigger a
<b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> failure under <b>&minus;c1</b>
or higher level. However, if the failure is undesired, the
pattern may be marked with the <i>optional</i> tag. Then if
the pattern does not match anything, it will only appear in
the diff as MISSING. Moreover, like any symbol, the pattern
may be limited to the specific architectures with the
<i>arch</i> tag. Please refer to <b>Standard symbol tags</b>
subsection above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Patterns are an
extension of the <b>deb&minus;symbols</b>(5) format hence
they are only valid in symbol file templates. Pattern
specification syntax is not any different from the one of a
specific symbol. However, symbol name part of the
specification serves as an expression to be matched against
<i>name@version</i> of the real symbol. In order to
distinguish among different pattern types, a pattern will
typically be tagged with a special tag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the moment,
<b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> supports three basic pattern
types: <b><br>
c++</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">This pattern is denoted by the
<i>c++</i> tag. It matches only C++ symbols by their
demangled symbol name (as emitted by <b>c++filt</b>(1)
utility). This pattern is very handy for matching symbols
which mangled names might vary across different
architectures while their demangled names remain the same.
One group of such symbols is <i>non&minus;virtual thunks</i>
which have architecture specific offsets embedded in their
mangled names. A common instance of this case is a virtual
destructor which under diamond inheritance needs a
non-virtual thunk symbol. For example, even if
_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 32bit architectures will
probably be _ZThn16_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 64bit ones, it
can be matched with a single <i>c++</i> pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">libdummy.so.1
libdummy1 #MINVER# <br>
[...] <br>
(c++)&quot;non&minus;virtual thunk to
NSB::ClassD::~ClassD()@Base&quot; 1.0 <br>
[...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The demangled
name above can be obtained by executing the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">$ echo
&rsquo;_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base&rsquo; | c++filt</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that while mangled name is unique in the library by
definition, this is not necessarily true for demangled
names. A couple of distinct real symbols may have the same
demangled name. For example, that&rsquo;s the case with
non-virtual thunk symbols in complex inheritance
configurations or with most constructors and destructors
(since g++ typically generates two real symbols for them).
However, as these collisions happen on the ABI level, they
should not degrade quality of the symbol file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>symver</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">This pattern is denoted by the
<i>symver</i> tag. Well maintained libraries have versioned
symbols where each version corresponds to the upstream
version where the symbol got added. If that&rsquo;s the
case, you can use a <i>symver</i> pattern to match any
symbol associated to the specific version. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">libc.so.6 libc6
#MINVER# <br>
(symver)GLIBC_2.0 2.0 <br>
[...] <br>
(symver)GLIBC_2.7 2.7 <br>
access@GLIBC_2.0 2.2</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">All symbols
associated with versions GLIBC_2.0 and GLIBC_2.7 will lead
to minimal version of 2.0 and 2.7 respectively with the
exception of the symbol access@GLIBC_2.0. The latter will
lead to a minimal dependency on libc6 version 2.2 despite
being in the scope of the &quot;(symver)GLIBC_2.0&quot;
pattern because specific symbols take precedence over
patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that while old style wildcard patterns (denoted by
&quot;*@version&quot; in the symbol name field) are still
supported, they have been deprecated by new style syntax
&quot;(symver|optional)version&quot;. For example,
&quot;*@GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; should be written as
&quot;(symver|optional)GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; if the same
behaviour is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>regex</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Regular expression patterns are
denoted by the <i>regex</i> tag. They match by the perl
regular expression specified in the symbol name field. A
regular expression is matched as it is, therefore do not
forget to start it with the <i>^</i> character or it may
match any part of the real symbol <i>name@version</i>
string. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">libdummy.so.1
libdummy1 #MINVER# <br>
(regex)&quot;^mystack_.*@Base$&quot; 1.0 <br>
(regex|optional)&quot;private&quot; 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Symbols like
&quot;mystack_new@Base&quot;, &quot;mystack_push@Base&quot;,
&quot;mystack_pop@Base&quot; etc. will be matched by the
first pattern while e.g. &quot;ng_mystack_new@Base&quot;
won&rsquo;t. The second pattern will match all symbols
having the string &quot;private&quot; in their names and
matches will inherit <i>optional</i> tag from the
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Basic patterns
listed above can be combined where it makes sense. In that
case, they are processed in the order in which the tags are
specified. For example, both</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(c++|regex)&quot;^NSA::ClassA::Private::privmethod\d\(int\)@Base&quot;
1.0 <br>
(regex|c++)N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will match
symbols
&quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod1Ei@Base&quot; and
&quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod2Ei@Base&quot;. When
matching the first pattern, the raw symbol is first
demangled as C++ symbol, then the demangled name is matched
against the regular expression. On the other hand, when
matching the second pattern, regular expression is matched
against the raw symbol name, then the symbol is tested if it
is C++ one by attempting to demangle it. A failure of any
basic pattern will result in the failure of the whole
pattern. Therefore, for example,
&quot;__N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base&quot; will
not match either of the patterns because it is not a valid
C++ symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, all
patterns are divided into two groups: aliases (basic
<i>c++</i> and <i>symver</i>) and generic patterns
(<i>regex</i>, all combinations of multiple basic patterns).
Matching of basic alias-based patterns is fast (O(1)) while
generic patterns are O(N) (N - generic pattern count) for
each symbol. Therefore, it is recommended not to overuse
generic patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When multiple
patterns match the same real symbol, aliases (first
<i>c++</i>, then <i>symver</i>) are preferred over generic
patterns. Generic patterns are matched in the order they are
found in the symbol file template until the first success.
Please note, however, that manual reordering of template
file entries is not recommended because
<b>dpkg&minus;gensymbols</b> generates diffs based on the
alphanumerical order of their names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
includes</b> <br>
When the set of exported symbols differ between
architectures, it may become inefficient to use a single
symbol file. In those cases, an include directive may prove
to be useful in a couple of ways:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>You can factorize the common part in some external file
and include that file in your
<i>package</i>.symbols.<i>arch</i> file by using an include
directive like this:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&quot;<i>packages</i>.symbols.common&quot;</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The include directive may also
be tagged like any symbol:</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(tag|...|tagN)#include
&quot;file-to-include&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a result,
all symbols included from <i>file-to-include</i> will be
considered to be tagged with <i>tag</i> ... <i>tagN</i> by
default. You can use this feature to create a common
<i>package</i>.symbols file which includes architecture
specific symbol files:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">common_symbol1@Base
1.0 <br>
(arch=amd64 ia64 alpha)#include
&quot;package.symbols.64bit&quot; <br>
(arch=!amd64 !ia64 !alpha)#include
&quot;package.symbols.32bit&quot; <br>
common_symbol2@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The symbols
files are read line by line, and include directives are
processed as soon as they are encountered. This means that
the content of the included file can override any content
that appeared before the include directive and that any
content after the directive can override anything contained
in the included file. Any symbol (or even another #include
directive) in the included file can specify additional tags
or override values of the inherited tags in its tag
specification. However, there is no way for the symbol to
remove any of the inherited tags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An included
file can repeat the header line containing the SONAME of the
library. In that case, it overrides any header line
previously read. However, in general it&rsquo;s best to
avoid duplicating header lines. One way to do it is the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&quot;libsomething1.symbols.common&quot; <br>
arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Good library
management</b> <br>
A well-maintained library has the following features:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">

<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">its API is stable (public

added) and changes in incompatible ways only when the SONAME

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">

<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>it doesn&rsquo;t export private symbols (such symbols

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While
maintaining the symbols file, it&rsquo;s easy to notice
appearance and disappearance of symbols. But it&rsquo;s more
difficult to catch incompatible API and ABI change. Thus the
maintainer should read thoroughly the upstream changelog
looking for cases where the rules of good library management
have been broken. If potential problems are discovered, the
upstream author should be notified as an upstream fix is
always better than a Debian specific work-around.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;P</b><i>package-build-dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Scan <i>package-build-dir</i>
instead of debian/tmp.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p</b><i>package</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the package name.
Required if more than one binary package is listed in
debian/control (or if there&rsquo;s no debian/control
file).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;v</b><i>version</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the package version.
Defaults to the version extracted from debian/changelog.
Required if called outside of a source package tree.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;e</b><i>library-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only analyze libraries
explicitly listed instead of finding all public libraries.
You can use shell patterns used for pathname expansions (see
the <b>File::Glob</b>(3perl) manual page for details) in
<i>library-file</i> to match multiple libraries with a
single argument (otherwise you need multiple
<b>&minus;e</b>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I</b><i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <i>filename</i> as
reference file to generate the symbols file that is
integrated in the package itself.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;O</b>[<i>filename</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the generated symbols
file to standard output or to <i>filename</i> if specified,
rather than to <b>debian/tmp/DEBIAN/symbols</b> (or
<i>package-build-dir</i><b>/DEBIAN/symbols</b> if
<b>&minus;P</b> was used). If <i>filename</i> is
pre-existing, its contents are used as basis for the
generated symbols file. You can use this feature to update a
symbols file so that it matches a newer upstream version of
your library.</p>

<p><b>&minus;t</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Write the symbol file in template mode rather than the
format compatible with <b>deb&minus;symbols</b>(5). The main
difference is that in the template mode symbol names and
tags are written in their original form contrary to the
post-processed symbol names with tags stripped in the
compatibility mode. Moreover, some symbols might be omitted
when writing a standard <b>deb&minus;symbols</b>(5) file
(according to the tag processing rules) while all symbols
are always written to the symbol file template.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b><i>[0-4]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the checks to do when
comparing the generated symbols file with the template file
used as starting point. By default the level is 1.
Increasing levels do more checks and include all checks of
lower levels. Level 0 never fails. Level 1 fails if some
symbols have disappeared. Level 2 fails if some new symbols
have been introduced. Level 3 fails if some libraries have
disappeared. Level 4 fails if some libraries have been
introduced.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This value can
be overridden by the environment variable

<p><b>&minus;q</b></p></td>

<p>Keep quiet and never generate a diff between generated
symbols file and the template file used as starting point or
show any warnings about new/lost libraries or new/lost
symbols. This option only disables informational output but
not the checks themselves (see <b>&minus;c</b> option).</p></td></tr>

diff for any architecture provided its binaries are already
available.</p> </td></tr>
