<h1>NAME</h1> intro - introduction to user commands</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> Section 1 of the manual describes user commands and tools, for example, file manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation all user commands under UNIX work precisely the same under Linux (and FreeBSD and lots of other UNIX-like systems).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Under Linux, there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first reading lots of documentation. The traditional UNIX environment is a CLI (command line interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do. That is faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands are. Below a bare minimum, to get started.<div class="subsection">
<h2>Login</h2> In order to start working, you probably first have to open a session by giving your username and password. The program <b>login</b>(1) now starts a <i>shell</i> (command interpreter) for you. In case of a graphical login, you get a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will start a shell in a window. See also <b>xterm</b>(1).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>The shell</h2> One types commands to the <i>shell</i>, the command interpreter. It is not built-in, but is just a program and you can change your shell. Everybody has her own favorite one. The standard one is called <i>sh</i>. See also <b>ash</b>(1), <b>bash</b>(1), <b>chsh</b>(1), <b>csh</b>(1), <b>dash</b>(1), <b>ksh</b>(1), <b>zsh</b>(1).<div class="spacer">

A session might go like:<div class="spacer">

Here typing Control-D ended the session.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>$</b> here was the command prompt&#8212;it is the shell's way of indicating that it is ready for the next command. The prompt can be customized in lots of ways, and one might include stuff like username, machine name, current directory, time, and so on. An assignment PS1=&quot;What next, master? &quot; would change the prompt as indicated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
We see that there are commands <i>date</i> (that gives date and time), and <i>cal</i> (that gives a calendar).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>ls</i> lists the contents of the current directory&#8212;it tells you what files you have. With a <i>-l</i> option it gives a long listing, that includes the owner and size and date of the file, and the permissions people have for reading and/or changing the file. For example, the file &quot;tel&quot; here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb and the owner can read and write it, others can only read it. Owner and permissions can be changed by the commands <i>chown</i> and <i>chmod</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>cat</i> will show the contents of a file. (The name is from &quot;concatenate and print&quot;: all files given as parameters are concatenated and sent to &quot;standard output&quot; (see <b>stdout</b>(3)), here the terminal screen.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>cp</i> (from &quot;copy&quot;) will copy a file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>mv</i> (from &quot;move&quot;), on the other hand, only renames it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>diff</i> lists the differences between two files. Here there was no output because there were no differences.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>rm</i> (from &quot;remove&quot;) deletes the file, and be careful! it is gone. No wastepaper basket or anything. Deleted means lost.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>grep</i> (from &quot;g/re/p&quot;) finds occurrences of a string in one or more files. Here it finds Maja's telephone number.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Pathnames and the current directory</h2> Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy. Each has a <i>pathname</i> describing the path from the root of the tree (which is called <i>/</i>) to the file. For example, such a full pathname might be <i>/home/aeb/tel</i>. Always using full pathnames would be inconvenient, and the name of a file in the current directory may be abbreviated by giving only the last component. That is why <i>/home/aeb/tel</i> can be abbreviated to <i>tel</i> when the current directory is <i>/home/aeb</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>pwd</i> prints the current directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>cd</i> changes the current directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Try alternatively <i>cd</i> and <i>pwd</i> commands and explore <i>cd</i> usage: &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;cd .&quot;, &quot;cd ..&quot;, &quot;cd /&quot; and &quot;cd ~&quot;.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Directories</h2> The command <i>mkdir</i> makes a new directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>rmdir</i> removes a directory if it is empty, and complains otherwise.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The command <i>find</i> (with a rather baroque syntax) will find files with given name or other properties. For example, &quot;find . -name tel&quot; would find the file <i>tel</i> starting in the present directory (which is called <i>.</i>). And &quot;find / -name tel&quot; would do the same, but starting at the root of the tree. Large searches on a multi-GB disk will be time-consuming, and it may be better to use <b>locate</b>(1).</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Disks and filesystems</h2> The command <i>mount</i> will attach the filesystem found on some disk (or floppy, or CDROM or so) to the big filesystem hierarchy. And <i>umount</i> detaches it again. The command <i>df</i> will tell you how much of your disk is still free.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Processes</h2> On a UNIX system many user and system processes run simultaneously. The one you are talking to runs in the <i>foreground</i>, the others in the <i>background</i>. The command <i>ps</i> will show you which processes are active and what numbers these processes have. The command <i>kill</i> allows you to get rid of them. Without option this is a friendly request: please go away. And &quot;kill -9&quot; followed by the number of the process is an immediate kill. Foreground processes can often be killed by typing Control-C.</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>Getting information</h2> There are thousands of commands, each with many options. Traditionally commands are documented on <i>man pages</i>, (like this one), so that the command &quot;man kill&quot; will document the use of the command &quot;kill&quot; (and &quot;man man&quot; document the command &quot;man&quot;). The program <i>man</i> sends the text through some <i>pager</i>, usually <i>less</i>. Hit the space bar to get the next page, hit q to quit.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In documentation it is customary to refer to man pages by giving the name and section number, as in <b>man</b>(1). Man pages are terse, and allow you to find quickly some forgotten detail. For newcomers an introductory text with more examples and explanations is useful.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files. Type &quot;info info&quot; for an introduction on the use of the program <i>info</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs. Look in <i>/usr/share/doc/howto/en</i> and use a browser if you find HTML files there.</div>
