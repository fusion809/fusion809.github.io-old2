<h1>NAME</h1> chown, fchownat &#8212; change owner and group of a file relative to directory file descriptor</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int chown(const char *<i>path</i>, uid_t <i>owner</i>, gid_t <i>group</i>);<br/>
int fchownat(int <i>fd</i>, const char *<i>path</i>, uid_t <i>owner</i>, gid_t <i>group</i>,<br/>

<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>chown</i>() function shall change the user and group ownership of a file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>path</i> argument points to a pathname naming a file. The user ID and group ID of the named file shall be set to the numeric values contained in <i>owner</i> and <i>group</i>, respectively.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Only processes with an effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file or with appropriate privileges may change the ownership of a file. If _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is in effect for <i>path</i>:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Changing the user ID is restricted to processes with appropriate privileges.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Changing the group ID is permitted to a process with an effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file, but without appropriate privileges, if and only if <i>owner</i> is equal to the file's user ID or (<b>uid_t</b>)&#8722;1 and <i>group</i> is equal either to the calling process' effective group ID or to one of its supplementary group IDs.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the specified file is a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and the process does not have appropriate privileges, the set-user-ID (S_ISUID) and set-group-ID (S_ISGID) bits of the file mode shall be cleared upon successful return from  <i>chown</i>(). If the specified file is a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and the process has appropriate privileges, it is implementation-defined whether the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are altered. If the  <i>chown</i>() function is successfully invoked on a file that is not a regular file and one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits may be cleared.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>owner</i> or <i>group</i> is specified as (<b>uid_t</b>)&#8722;1 or (<b>gid_t</b>)&#8722;1, respectively, the corresponding ID of the file shall not be changed. If both owner and group are &#8722;1, the times need not be updated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Upon successful completion,  <i>chown</i>() shall mark for update the last file status change timestamp of the file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>fchownat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the  <i>chown</i>() and  <i>lchown</i>() functions except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path. In this case the file to be changed is determined relative to the directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the current working directory. If the file descriptor was opened without O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted using the current permissions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the file descriptor was opened with O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Values for <i>flag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:<dl>
<dt>
AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, ownership of the symbolic link is changed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If  <i>fchownat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i> parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the behavior shall be identical to a call to  <i>chown</i>() or  <i>lchown</i>() respectively, depending on whether or not the AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW bit is set in the <i>flag</i> argument.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0. Otherwise, these functions shall return &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error. If &#8722;1 is returned, no changes are made in the user ID and group ID of the file.</div>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Although  <i>chown</i>() can be used on some implementations by the file owner to change the owner and group to any desired values, the only portable use of this function is to change the group of a file to the effective GID of the calling process or to a member of its group set.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> System III and System V allow a user to give away files; that is, the owner of a file may change its user ID to anything. This is a serious problem for implementations that are intended to meet government security regulations. Version 7 and 4.3 BSD permit only the superuser to change the user ID of a file. Some government agencies (usually not ones concerned directly with security) find this limitation too confining. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 uses  <i>may</i> to permit secure implementations while not disallowing System V.<div class="spacer">
</div>
System III and System V allow the owner of a file to change the group ID to anything. Version 7 permits only the superuser to change the group ID of a file. 4.3 BSD permits the owner to change the group ID of a file to its effective group ID or to any of the groups in the list of supplementary group IDs, but to no others.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The POSIX.1&#8208;1990 standard requires that the  <i>chown</i>() function invoked by a non-appropriate privileged process clear the S_ISGID and the S_ISUID bits for regular files, and permits them to be cleared for other types of files. This is so that changes in accessibility do not accidentally cause files to become security holes. Unfortunately, requiring these bits to be cleared on non-executable data files also clears the mandatory file locking bit (shared with S_ISGID), which is an extension on many implementations (it first appeared in System V). These bits should only be required to be cleared on regular files that have one or more of their execute bits set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The purpose of the  <i>fchownat</i>() function is to enable changing ownership of files in directories other than the current working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to  <i>chown</i>() or  <i>lchown</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the target directory and using the  <i>fchownat</i>() function it can be guaranteed that the changed file is located relative to the desired directory.</div>
