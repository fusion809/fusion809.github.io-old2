<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The procedures  <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>,  <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>, and <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b> are used to create new windows for use in Tk-based applications.  Each of the procedures returns a token that can be used to manipulate the window in other calls to the Tk library.  If the window could not be created successfully, then NULL is returned and  <i>interp-&gt;result</i> is modified to hold an error message.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Tk supports two different kinds of windows:  internal windows and top-level windows. An internal window is an interior window of a Tk application, such as a scrollbar or menu bar or button.  A top-level window is one that is created as a child of a screen's root window, rather than as an interior window, but which is logically part of some existing main window.  Examples of top-level windows are pop-up menus and dialog boxes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
New windows may be created by calling  <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>.  If the <i>topLevScreen</i> argument is NULL, then the new window will be an internal window.  If  <i>topLevScreen</i> is non-NULL, then the new window will be a top-level window:  <i>topLevScreen</i> indicates the name of a screen and the new window will be created as a child of the root window of  <i>topLevScreen</i>.  In either case Tk will consider the new window to be the logical child of  <i>parent</i>: the new window's path name will reflect this fact, options may be specified for the new window under this assumption, and so on. The only difference is that new X window for a top-level window will not be a child of  <i>parent</i>'s X window.  For example, a pull-down menu's  <i>parent</i> would be the button-like window used to invoke it, which would in turn be a child of the menu bar window.  A dialog box might have the application's main window as its parent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b> differs from <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> in that it creates an unnamed window.  This window will be manipulable only using C interfaces, and will not be visible to Tcl scripts.  Both interior windows and top-level windows may be created with  <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b> offers an alternate way of specifying new windows.  In  <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b> the new window is specified with a token for any window in the target application ( <i>tkwin</i>), plus a path name for the new window. It produces the same effect as  <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> and allows both top-level and internal windows to be created, depending on the value of  <i>topLevScreen</i>.  In calls to <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b>, as in calls to  <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>, the parent of the new window must exist at the time of the call, but the new window must not already exist.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The window creation procedures do not actually issue the command to X to create a window. Instead, they create a local data structure associated with the window and defer the creation of the X window. The window will actually be created by the first call to  <b>Tk_MapWindow</b>.  Deferred window creation allows various aspects of the window (such as its size, background color, etc.) to be modified after its creation without incurring any overhead in the X server.  When the window is finally mapped all of the window attributes can be set while creating the window.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The value returned by a window-creation procedure is not the X token for the window (it cannot be, since X has not been asked to create the window yet).  Instead, it is a token for Tk's local data structure for the window.  Most of the Tk library procedures take Tk_Window tokens, rather than X identifiers.  The actual X window identifier can be retrieved from the local data structure using the  <b>Tk_WindowId</b> macro;  see the manual entry for  <b>Tk_WindowId</b> for details.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Tk_DestroyWindow</b> deletes a window and all the data structures associated with it, including any event handlers created with  <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b>.  In addition,  <b>Tk_DestroyWindow</b> will delete any children of <i>tkwin</i> recursively (where children are defined in the Tk sense, consisting of all windows that were created with the given window as  <i>parent</i>). If  <i>tkwin</i> is an internal window, then event handlers interested in destroy events are invoked immediately.  If  <i>tkwin</i> is a top-level or main window, then the event handlers will be invoked later, after X has seen the request and returned an event for it.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a window has been created but has not been mapped, so no X window exists, it is possible to force the creation of the X window by calling  <b>Tk_MakeWindowExist</b>.  This procedure issues the X commands to instantiate the window given by  <i>tkwin</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
