<h1>NAME</h1> mv &#8212; move files</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
mv <b>[</b>&#8722;if<b>] </b><i>source_file target_file</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
mv <b>[</b>&#8722;if<b>] </b><i>source_file</i>... <i>target_dir</i><br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> In the first synopsis form, the <i>mv</i> utility shall move the file named by the <i>source_file</i> operand to the destination specified by the <i>target_file</i>. This first synopsis form is assumed when the final operand does not name an existing directory and is not a symbolic link referring to an existing directory. In this case, if <i>source_file</i> names a non-directory file and <i>target_file</i> ends with a trailing &lt;slash&gt; character, <i>mv</i> shall treat this as an error and no <i>source_file</i> operands will be processed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the second synopsis form, <i>mv</i> shall move each file named by a <i>source_file</i> operand to a destination file in the existing directory named by the <i>target_dir</i> operand, or referenced if <i>target_dir</i> is a symbolic link referring to an existing directory. The destination path for each <i>source_file</i> shall be the concatenation of the target directory, a single &lt;slash&gt; character if the target did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the last pathname component of the <i>source_file</i>. This second form is assumed when the final operand names an existing directory.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If any operand specifies an existing file of a type not specified by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, the behavior is implementation-defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For each <i>source_file</i> the following steps shall be taken:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
If the destination path exists, the <b>&#8722;f</b> option is not specified, and either of the following conditions is true:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
 a.</dt>
<dd>
The permissions of the destination path do not permit writing and the standard input is a terminal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 b.</dt>
<dd>
The <b>&#8722;i</b> option is specified.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
the <i>mv</i> utility shall write a prompt to standard error and read a line from standard input. If the response is not affirmative, <i>mv</i> shall do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
If the <i>source_file</i> operand and destination path name the same existing file, then the destination path shall not be removed, and one of the following shall occur:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
 a.</dt>
<dd>
No change is made to <i>source_file</i>, no error occurs, and no diagnostic is issued.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 b.</dt>
<dd>
No change is made to <i>source_file</i>, a diagnostic is issued to standard error identifying the two names, and the exit status is affected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 c.</dt>
<dd>
If the <i>source_file</i> operand and destination path name distinct directory entries, then the <i>source_file</i> operand is removed, no error occurs, and no diagnostic is issued.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mv</i> utility shall do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
 3.</dt>
<dd>
The <i>mv</i> utility shall perform actions equivalent to the  <i>rename</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, called with the following arguments:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
 a.</dt>
<dd>
The <i>source_file</i> operand is used as the <i>old</i> argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 b.</dt>
<dd>
The destination path is used as the <i>new</i> argument.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If this succeeds, <i>mv</i> shall do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s. If this fails for any reasons other than those described for the <i>errno</i> <b>[EXDEV]</b> in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
 4.</dt>
<dd>
If the destination path exists, and it is a file of type directory and <i>source_file</i> is not a file of type directory, or it is a file not of type directory and <i>source_file</i> is a file of type directory, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s. If the destination path exists and was created by a previous step, it is unspecified whether this will treated as an error or the destination path will be overwritten.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 5.</dt>
<dd>
If the destination path exists, <i>mv</i> shall attempt to remove it. If this fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 6.</dt>
<dd>
The file hierarchy rooted in <i>source_file</i> shall be duplicated as a file hierarchy rooted in the destination path. If <i>source_file</i> or any of the files below it in the hierarchy are symbolic links, the links themselves shall be duplicated, including their contents, rather than any files to which they refer. The following characteristics of each file in the file hierarchy shall be duplicated:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The time of last data modification and time of last access</dd>

The user ID and group ID</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
The file mode</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the user ID, group ID, or file mode of a regular file cannot be duplicated, the file mode bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID shall not be duplicated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When files are duplicated to another file system, the implementation may require that the process invoking <i>mv</i> has read access to each file being duplicated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If files being duplicated to another file system have hard links to other files, it is unspecified whether the files copied to the new file system have the hard links preserved or separate copies are created for the linked files.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the duplication of the file hierarchy fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the duplication of the file characteristics fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, but this failure shall not cause <i>mv</i> to modify its exit status.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
 7.</dt>
<dd>
The file hierarchy rooted in <i>source_file</i> shall be removed. If this fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to the standard error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.</dd>

<h1>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h1> If the copying or removal of <i>source_file</i> is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, <i>mv</i> may leave a partial copy of <i>source_file</i> at the source or destination. The <i>mv</i> utility shall not modify both <i>source_file</i> and the destination path simultaneously; termination at any point shall leave either <i>source_file</i> or the destination path complete.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Some implementations mark for update the last file status change timestamp of renamed files and some do not. Applications which make use of the last file status change timestamp may behave differently with respect to renamed files unless they are designed to allow for either behavior.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The specification ensures that <i>mv</i> <b>a</b> <b>a</b> will not alter the contents of file <b>a</b>, and allows the implementation to issue an error that a file cannot be moved onto itself. Likewise, when <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are hard links to the same file, <i>mv</i> <b>a</b> <b>b</b> will not alter <b>b</b>, but if a diagnostic is not issued, then it is unspecified whether <b>a</b> is left untouched (as it would be by the  <i>rename</i>() function) or unlinked (reducing the link count of <b>b</b>).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> If the current directory contains only files <b>a</b> (of any type defined by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008), <b>b</b> (also of any type), and a directory <b>c</b>:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>mv a b c</b><br/>
<b>mv c d</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
results with the original files <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> residing in the directory <b>d</b> in the current directory.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Early proposals diverged from the SVID and BSD historical practice in that they required that when the destination path exists, the <b>&#8722;f</b> option is not specified, and input is not a terminal, <i>mv</i> fails. This was done for compatibility with <i>cp</i>. The current text returns to historical practice. It should be noted that this is consistent with the  <i>rename</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, which does not require write permission on the target.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For absolute clarity, paragraph (1), describing the behavior of <i>mv</i> when prompting for confirmation, should be interpreted in the following manner:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>if (exists AND (NOT f_option) AND</b><br/>
<b>    ((not_writable AND input_is_terminal) OR i_option))</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>&#8722;i</b> option exists on BSD systems, giving applications and users a way to avoid accidentally unlinking files when moving others. When the standard input is not a terminal, the 4.3 BSD <i>mv</i> deletes all existing destination paths without prompting, even when <b>&#8722;i</b> is specified; this is inconsistent with the behavior of the 4.3 BSD <i>cp</i> utility, which always generates an error when the file is unwritable and the standard input is not a terminal. The standard developers decided that use of <b>&#8722;i</b> is a request for interaction, so when the destination path exists, the utility takes instructions from whatever responds to standard input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>rename</i>() function is able to move directories within the same file system. Some historical versions of <i>mv</i> have been able to move directories, but not to a different file system. The standard developers considered that this was an annoying inconsistency, so this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 requires directories to be able to be moved even across file systems. There is no <b>&#8722;R</b> option to confirm that moving a directory is actually intended, since such an option was not required for moving directories in historical practice. Requiring the application to specify it sometimes, depending on the destination, seemed just as inconsistent. The semantics of the  <i>rename</i>() function were preserved as much as possible. For example, <i>mv</i> is not permitted to ``rename'' files to or from directories, even though they might be empty and removable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Historic implementations of <i>mv</i> did not exit with a non-zero exit status if they were unable to duplicate any file characteristics when moving a file across file systems, nor did they write a diagnostic message for the user. The former behavior has been preserved to prevent scripts from breaking; a diagnostic message is now required, however, so that users are alerted that the file characteristics have changed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified because implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used on historical implementations. Therefore, an application not using the <b>&#8722;f</b> option or using the <b>&#8722;i</b> option relies on the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on the behavior specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>mv</i> is dealing with a single file system and <i>source_file</i> is a symbolic link, the link itself is moved as a consequence of the dependence on the  <i>rename</i>() functionality, per the DESCRIPTION. Across file systems, this has to be made explicit.</div>
