<h1>NAME</h1> mlockall, munlockall &#8212; lock/unlock the address space of a process ( <b>REALTIME</b>)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int mlockall(int <i>flags</i>);<br/>
int munlockall(void);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>mlockall</i>() function shall cause all of the pages mapped by the address space of a process to be memory-resident until unlocked or until the process exits or <i>exec</i>s another process image. The <i>flags</i> argument determines whether the pages to be locked are those currently mapped by the address space of the process, those that are mapped in the future, or both. The <i>flags</i> argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of the following symbolic constants, defined in <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>:<dl>
<dt>
MCL_CURRENT</dt>
<dd>
Lock all of the pages currently mapped into the address space of the process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
MCL_FUTURE</dt>
<dd>
Lock all of the pages that become mapped into the address space of the process in the future, when those mappings are established.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If MCL_FUTURE is specified, and the automatic locking of future mappings eventually causes the amount of locked memory to exceed the amount of available physical memory or any other implementation-defined limit, the behavior is implementation-defined. The manner in which the implementation informs the application of these situations is also implementation-defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>munlockall</i>() function shall unlock all currently mapped pages of the address space of the process. Any pages that become mapped into the address space of the process after a call to  <i>munlockall</i>() shall not be locked, unless there is an intervening call to  <i>mlockall</i>() specifying MCL_FUTURE or a subsequent call to  <i>mlockall</i>() specifying MCL_CURRENT. If pages mapped into the address space of the process are also mapped into the address spaces of other processes and are locked by those processes, the locks established by the other processes shall be unaffected by a call by this process to  <i>munlockall</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
Upon successful return from the  <i>mlockall</i>() function that specifies MCL_CURRENT, all currently mapped pages of the address space of the process shall be memory-resident and locked. Upon return from the  <i>munlockall</i>() function, all currently mapped pages of the address space of the process shall be unlocked with respect to the address space of the process. The memory residency of unlocked pages is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Appropriate privileges are required to lock process memory with  <i>mlockall</i>().</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, the  <i>mlockall</i>() function shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, no additional memory shall be locked, and the function shall return a value of &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error. The effect of failure of  <i>mlockall</i>() on previously existing locks in the address space is unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If it is supported by the implementation, the  <i>munlockall</i>() function shall always return a value of zero. Otherwise, the function shall return a value of &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>mlockall</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
Some or all of the memory identified by the operation could not be locked when the call was made.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The <i>flags</i> argument is zero, or includes unimplemented flags.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>mlockall</i>() function may fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOMEM</b></dt>
<dd>
Locking all of the pages currently mapped into the address space of the process would exceed an implementation-defined limit on the amount of memory that the process may lock.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPERM</b></dt>
<dd>
The calling process does not have appropriate privileges to perform the requested operation.</dd>
