<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>  <b>emerge</b> is the definitive command-line interface to the Portage system.  It is primarily used for installing packages, and  <b>emerge</b> can automatically handle any dependencies that the desired package has.  <b>emerge</b> can also update the <b>portage tree</b>, making new and updated packages available.   <b>emerge</b> gracefully handles updating installed packages to newer releases as well.  It handles both source and binary packages, and it can be used to create binary packages for distribution.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EBUILDS, TBZ2S, SETS AND ATOMS</h1>  <b>emerge</b> primarily installs packages.  You can specify packages to install in five possible ways: an  <i>atom</i>, a  <i>set</i>, an installed <i>file</i>, an <i>ebuild</i>, or a  <i>tbz2file</i>.<dl>
<dt>
<b>ebuild</b></dt>
<dd>
An <i>ebuild</i> must be, at a minimum, a valid Portage package directory name without a version or category, such as  <b>portage</b> or <b>python</b>. Both categories and version numbers may be used in addition, such as  <b>sys-apps/portage</b> or <b>=python-2.2.1-r2</b>.  <b>emerge</b> ignores a trailing slash so that filename completion can be used. The  <i>ebuild</i> may also be an actual filename, such as  <b>/usr/portage/app-admin/python/python-2.2.1-r2.ebuild</b>.  <b>WARNING:</b> The implementation of <b>emerge /path/to/ebuild</b> is broken and so this syntax shouldn't be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>tbz2file</b></dt>
<dd>
A <i>tbz2file</i> must be a valid .tbz2 created with <b>ebuild</b>  <b>&lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.ebuild package</b> or <b>emerge --buildpkg</b>  <b>[category/]&lt;package&gt;</b> or <b>quickpkg /var/db/pkg/&lt;category&gt;/&lt;package&gt;</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>file</b></dt>
<dd>
A <i>file</i> must be a file or directory that has been installed by one or more packages. If an absolute path is not used, then it must begin with either &quot;./&quot; or &quot;../&quot;. For directories that are owned by multiple packages, all owning packages will be selected. See the portageq(1) owners command if you would like to query the owners of one or more files or directories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>set</b></dt>
<dd>
A <i>set</i> is a convenient shorthand for a large group of packages. Six sets are currently always available:  <b>selected-packages</b>,  <b>selected-sets</b>, <b>selected</b>, <b>system</b>, <b>profile</b>, and <b>world</b>.  <b>selected-packages</b> contains the user-selected &quot;world&quot; packages that are listed in  <b>/var/lib/portage/world</b>, while <b>selected-sets</b> contains the nested sets that may be listed in  <b>/var/lib/portage/world_sets</b>.  <b>system</b> and <b>profile</b> both refer to sets of packages deemed necessary for your system to run properly (the differences between these two sets are documented in  <b>portage</b>(5)).  <b>selected</b> encompasses both the <b>selected-packages</b> and  <b>selected-sets</b> sets, while <b>world</b> encompasses the <b>selected</b>,  <b>system</b> and <b>profile</b> sets. (See <b>FILES</b> below for more information.) Other sets can exist depending on the current configuration. The default set configuration is located in the  <b>/usr/share/portage/config/sets</b> directory. User sets may be created by placing files in the  <b>/etc/portage/sets/</b> directory (see  <b>portage</b>(5)). Note that a <i>set</i> is generally used in conjunction with  <b>--update</b>. When used as arguments to  <b>emerge</b> sets have to be prefixed with <b>@</b> to be recognized. Use the  <b>--list-sets</b> action to display a list of available package sets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>atom</b></dt>
<dd>
An <i>atom</i> describes bounds on a package that you wish to install.  <i>See ebuild(5) for the details on atom syntax.</i>  For example,  <b>&gt;=dev-lang/python-2.2.1-r2</b> matches the latest available version of Python greater than or equal to 2.2.1-r2.  Similarly,  <b>&lt;dev-lang/python-2.0</b> matches the latest available version of Python before 2.0.  Note that in many shells you will need to escape characters such as '&lt;' and '='; use single- or double-quotes around the  <i>atom</i> to get around escaping problems. You may also constrain an atom to match a specific  <b>SLOT</b> by appending a colon and a <b>SLOT</b>. Example:  <b>x11-libs/qt:3</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ACTIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>No action</b></dt>
<dd>
If no action is specified, the action is to merge in the specified packages, satisfying any dependencies that they may have.  The arguments can be  <i>atoms</i>, <i>sets</i>, installed <i>files</i>,  <i>ebuilds</i>, or <i>tbz2s</i>.  <b>Note that you need to use the --usepkg</b>  <b>option if you want to install a tbz2</b>.  The packages are added to the  <b>world</b> file at the end, so that they are considered for later updating.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--check-news</b></dt>
<dd>
Scan all repositories for relevant unread GLEP 42 news items, and display how many are found. See  <i>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0042.html</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--clean</b></dt>
<dd>
Cleans up the system by examining the installed packages and removing older packages.  This is accomplished by looking at each installed package and separating the installed versions by  <b>slot</b>.  Clean will <b>remove all but</b>  <b>the most recently installed version in each </b>slot.  Clean should not remove unslotted packages. Note: Most recently installed means most  <b>recent</b>, not highest version.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--config </b></dt>
<dd>
Run package specific actions needed to be executed after the emerge process has completed.  This usually entails configuration file setup or other similar setups that the user may wish to run.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--depclean (-c)</b></dt>
<dd>
Cleans the system by removing packages that are not associated with explicitly merged packages. Depclean works by creating the full dependency tree from the @world set, then comparing it to installed packages. Packages installed, but not part of the dependency tree, will be uninstalled by depclean. See  <b>--with-bdeps</b> for behavior with respect to build time dependencies that are not strictly required. Packages that are part of the world set will always be kept. They can be manually added to this set with  <i>emerge</i>  <i>--noreplace &lt;atom&gt;</i>. As a safety measure, depclean will not remove any packages unless *all* required dependencies have been resolved. As a consequence, it is often necessary to run  <i>emerge --update --newuse</i>  <i>--deep @world</i> prior to depclean. Also note that depclean may break link level dependencies, especially when the  <b>--depclean-lib-check</b> option is disabled. Thus, it is recommended to use a tool such as  <b>revdep-rebuild</b>(1) in order to detect such breakage.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>WARNING:</b> Inexperienced users are advised to use  <b>--pretend</b> or <b>--ask</b> with this option in order to see a preview of which packages will be uninstalled. Always study the list of packages to be cleaned for any obvious mistakes. Note that packages listed in package.provided (see  <b>portage</b>(5)) may be removed by depclean, even if they are part of the world set.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Depclean serves as a dependency aware version of  <b>--unmerge</b>. When given one or more atoms, it will unmerge matched packages that have no reverse dependencies. Use  <b>--depclean</b> together with <b>--verbose</b> to show reverse dependencies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--deselect [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Remove atoms and/or sets from the world file. This action is implied by uninstall actions, including  <b>--depclean</b>,  <b>--prune</b> and <b>--unmerge</b>. Use <b>--deselect=n</b> in order to prevent uninstall actions from removing atoms from the world file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--help </b>(<b>-h</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Displays help information for emerge.  Adding one of the additional arguments listed above will give you more specific help information on that subject.  The internal  <b>emerge</b> help documentation is updated more frequently than this man page; check it out if you are having problems that this man page does not help resolve.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--info</b></dt>
<dd>
Produces a list of information to include in bug reports which aids the developers when fixing the reported problem.   <b>Please include this</b>  <b>information when submitting a bug report.</b>  Expanded output can be obtained with the  <i>--verbose</i> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--list-sets</b></dt>
<dd>
Displays a list of available package sets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--metadata</b></dt>
<dd>
Transfers pregenerated metadata cache from ${repository_location}/metadata/md5-cache/ to /var/cache/edb/dep/ as is normally done on the tail end of an rsync update using  <b>emerge --sync</b>. This process populates the cache database that Portage uses for pre-parsed lookups of package data. It does not populate cache for repositories not distributing pregenerated metadata cache. In order to generate cache for these repositories, use  <b>--regen</b>. In versions of portage &gt;=2.1.5 the --metadata action is totally unnecessary unless the user has enabled FEATURES=&quot;metadata-transfer&quot; in  <b>make.conf</b>(5).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--prune </b>(<b>-P</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Removes all but the highest installed version of a package from your system. Use  <b>--prune</b> together with <b>--verbose</b> to show reverse dependencies or with  <b>--nodeps</b> to ignore all dependencies.  <b>WARNING: This action can remove packages from your world file! Check</b>  <b>the emerge output of the next --depclean run carefully! Use</b>  <b>--depclean to avoid this issue.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--regen</b></dt>
<dd>
Causes portage to check and update the dependency cache of all ebuilds in the portage tree.  The cache is used to speed up searches and the building of dependency trees.  This command is not recommended for rsync users as rsync updates the cache using server-side caches.  If you do not know the differences between a 'rsync user' and some other user, then you are a 'rsync user' :).  Rsync users should simply run  <b>emerge --sync</b> to regenerate the cache.  After a portage update, rsync users may find it convenient to run  <b>emerge --metadata</b> to rebuild the cache as portage does at the end of a sync operation. In order to specify parallel  <b>--regen</b> behavior, use the  <b>--jobs</b> and <b>--load-average</b> options. If you would like to generate and distribute cache for use by others, use  <b>egencache</b>(1).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--resume</b>(<b>-r</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Resumes the most recent merge list that has been aborted due to an error. This re-uses the arguments and options that were given with the original command that's being resumed, and the user may also provide additional options when calling  <b>--resume</b>. It is an error to provide atoms or sets as arguments to  <b>--resume</b>, since the arguments from the resumed command are used instead. Please note that this operation will only return an error on failure.  If there is nothing for portage to do, then portage will exit with a message and a success condition. A resume list will persist until it has been completed in entirety or until another aborted merge list replaces it.  The resume history is capable of storing two merge lists.  After one resume list completes, it is possible to invoke --resume once again in order to resume an older list. The resume lists are stored in  <i>/var/cache/edb/mtimedb</i>, and may be explicitly discarded by running `emaint --fix cleanresume` (see  <b>emaint</b>(1)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--search </b>(<b>-s</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Searches for matches of the supplied string in the portage tree. By default emerge uses a case-insensitive simple search, but you can enable a regular expression search by prefixing the search string with %. For example,  <b>emerge --search &quot;%^kde&quot;</b> searches for any package whose name starts with &quot;kde&quot;;  <b>emerge --search &quot;%gcc$&quot;</b> searches for any package that ends with &quot;gcc&quot;;  <b>emerge --search &quot;office&quot;</b> searches for any package that contains the word &quot;office&quot;.  If you want to include the category into the search string, prepend an @:  <b>emerge --search</b>  <b>&quot;%@^dev-java.*jdk&quot;</b>. If you want to search the package descriptions as well, use the  <b>--searchdesc</b> action.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--searchdesc </b>(<b>-S</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Matches the search string against the description field as well as the package name.   <b>Take caution</b> as the descriptions are also matched as regular expressions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--sync</b></dt>
<dd>
Updates repositories, for which auto-sync, sync-type and sync-uri attributes are set in repos.conf. See  <b>portage</b>(5) for more information. The  <b>PORTAGE_SYNC_STALE</b> variable configures warnings that are shown when emerge --sync has not been executed recently.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>WARNING:</b> The emerge --sync action will revert local changes (e.g. modifications or additions of files) inside repositories synchronized using rsync.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>NOTE:</b> The emerge --sync command is a compatibility command.  Sync operations are now performed using the the new emaint sync module. This new emaint sync module has greater functionality and flexibility.  Please refer to  <b>emaint</b>(1) for more information about sync operations.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>NOTE:</b> The  <b>emerge-webrsync</b> program will download the entire portage tree as a tarball, which is much faster than emerge --sync for first time syncs.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--unmerge </b>(<b>-C</b>)</dt>
<dd>
<b>WARNING: This action can remove important packages!</b> Removes all matching packages following a counter governed by  <b>CLEAN_DELAY</b>. This does no checking of dependencies, so it may remove packages necessary for the proper operation of your system.  Its arguments can be  <i>atoms</i> or  <i>ebuilds</i>. For a dependency aware version of <b>--unmerge</b>, use  <b>--depclean</b> or <b>--prune</b>.  For a version with  <b>CLEAN_DELAY=0</b>, use <b>--rage-clean</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--version </b>(<b>-V</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Displays the version number of <b>emerge</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>--accept-properties=ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b></dt>
<dd>
This option temporarily overrides the <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> variable. The  <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> variable is incremental, which means that the specified setting is appended to the existing value from your configuration. The special  <b>-*</b> token can be used to discard the existing configuration value and start fresh. See the  <b>MASKED PACKAGES</b> section and  <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about ACCEPT_PROPERTIES. A typical usage example for this option would be to use  <i>--accept-properties=-interactive</i> to temporarily mask interactive packages. With default configuration, this would result in an effective  <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> value of &quot;* -interactive&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--accept-restrict=ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b></dt>
<dd>
This option temporarily overrides the <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> variable. The  <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> variable is incremental, which means that the specified setting is appended to the existing value from your configuration. The special  <b>-*</b> token can be used to discard the existing configuration value and start fresh. See the  <b>MASKED PACKAGES</b> section and  <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about ACCEPT_RESTRICT. A typical usage example for this option would be to use  <i>--accept-restrict=-bindist</i> to temporarily mask packages that are not binary re-distributable. With default configuration, this would result in an effective  <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> value of &quot;* -bindist&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--alert [ y | n ] (-A short option)</b></dt>
<dd>
Add a terminal bell character ('\a') to all interactive prompts. This is especially useful if dependency resolution is taking a long time, and you want emerge to alert you when it is finished. If you use  <b>emerge -auAD world</b>, emerge will courteously point out when it has finished calculating the graph.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>--alert</b> may be 'y' or 'n'. 'true' and 'false' mean the same thing. Using  <b>--alert</b> without an option is the same as using it with 'y'. Try it with 'emerge -aA portage'.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If your terminal emulator is set up to make '\a' into a window manager urgency hint, move your cursor to a different window to get the effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--alphabetical </b></dt>
<dd>
When displaying USE and other flag output, combines the enabled and disabled lists into one list and sorts the whole list alphabetically.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--ask [ y | n ] (-a short option)</b></dt>
<dd>
Before performing the action, display what will take place (server info for  <b>--sync</b>, <b>--pretend</b> output for merge, and so forth), then ask whether to proceed with the action or abort.  Using  <b>--ask</b> is more efficient than using  <b>--pretend</b> and then executing the same command without  <b>--pretend</b>, as dependencies will only need to be calculated once.  <b>WARNING: If the &quot;Enter&quot; key is pressed at the prompt (with no other</b>  <b>input), it is interpreted as acceptance of the first choice.  Note that the</b>  <b>input</b>  <b>buffer is not cleared prior to the prompt, so an accidental press of the</b>  <b>&quot;Enter&quot; key at any time prior to the prompt will be interpreted as a choice!</b>  <b>Use the --ask-enter-invalid option if you want a single &quot;Enter&quot; key</b>  <b>press to be interpreted as invalid input.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--ask-enter-invalid</b></dt>
<dd>
When used together with the <b>--ask</b> option, interpret a single &quot;Enter&quot; key press as invalid input. This helps prevent accidental acceptance of the first choice. This option is intended to be set in the  <b>make.conf</b>(5)  <b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--autounmask [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Automatically unmask packages and generate package.use settings as necessary to satisfy dependencies. This option is enabled by default. If any configuration changes are required, then they will be displayed after the merge list and emerge will immediately abort. If the displayed configuration changes are satisfactory, you should copy and paste them into the specified configuration file(s), or enable the  <b>--autounmask-write</b> option. The  <b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> variable may be used to disable this option by default in  <b>make.conf</b>(5).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--autounmask-unrestricted-atoms [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
If --autounmask is enabled, keyword and mask changes using the &#180;=&#180; operator will be written. With this option, &#180;&gt;=&#180; operators will be used whenever possible. USE and license changes always use the latter behavior.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--autounmask-keep-masks [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
If --autounmask is enabled, no package.unmask or ** keyword changes will be created. This leads to unsatisfied dependencies if no other solution exists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--autounmask-write [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
If --autounmask is enabled, changes are written to config files, respecting  <b>CONFIG_PROTECT</b> and <b>--ask</b>. If the corresponding package.* is a file, the changes are appended to it, if it is a directory, changes are written to the lexicographically last file. This way it is always ensured that the new changes take precedence over existing changes. This option is automatically enabled with --ask.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--backtrack=COUNT</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies an integer number of times to backtrack if dependency calculation fails due to a conflict or an unsatisfied dependency (default: &#180;3&#180;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--binpkg-changed-deps [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to ignore binary packages for which the corresponding ebuild dependencies have changed since the packages were built. In order to help avoid issues with resolving inconsistent dependencies, this option is automatically enabled unless the  <b>--usepkgonly</b> option is enabled. Behavior with respect to changed build-time dependencies is controlled by the  <b>--with-bdeps</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--binpkg-respect-use [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to ignore binary packages if their USE flags don't match the current configuration. In order to help avoid issues with resolving inconsistent USE flag settings, this option is automatically enabled unless the  <b>--usepkgonly</b> option is enabled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--buildpkg [ y | n ] (-b short option)</b></dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to build binary packages for all ebuilds processed in addition to actually merging the packages.  Useful for maintainers or if you administrate multiple Gentoo Linux systems (build once, emerge tbz2s everywhere) as well as disaster recovery. The package will be created in the  <b>PKGDIR</b> directory (see <b>make.conf</b>(5)). An alternative for already-merged packages is to use  <b>quickpkg</b>(1) which creates a tbz2 from the live filesystem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--buildpkg-exclude </b>ATOMS</dt>
<dd>
A space separated list of package atoms for which no binary packages should be built. This option overrides all possible ways to enable building of binary packages except for the downgrade-backup and unmerge-backup  <b>FEATURES</b> settings (see  <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about <b>FEATURES</b> settings).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--buildpkgonly </b>(<b>-B</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Creates binary packages for all ebuilds processed without actually merging the packages.  This comes with the caveat that all build-time dependencies must already be emerged on the system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--changed-deps [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to replace installed packages for which the corresponding ebuild dependencies have changed since the packages were built. This option also implies the  <b>--selective</b> option. Behavior with respect to changed build-time dependencies is controlled by the  <b>--with-bdeps</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--changed-use </b>(<b>-U</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to include installed packages where USE flags have changed since installation. This option also implies the  <b>--selective</b> option. Unlike <b>--newuse</b>, the  <b>--changed-use</b> option does not trigger reinstallation when flags that the user has not enabled are added or removed.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
NOTE: This option ignores the state of the &quot;test&quot; USE flag, since that flag has a special binding to FEATURES=&quot;test&quot; (see  <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about  <b>FEATURES</b> settings).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--changelog </b>(<b>-l</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Use this in conjunction with the <b>--pretend</b> option.  This will show the ChangeLog entries for all the packages that will be upgraded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--color &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable or disable color output.  This option will override <i>NOCOLOR</i> (see  <b>make.conf</b>(5)) and may also be used to force color output when stdout is not a tty (by default, color is disabled unless stdout is a tty).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--columns</b></dt>
<dd>
Used alongside <b>--pretend</b> to cause the package name, new version, and old version to be displayed in an aligned format for easy cut-n-paste.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--complete-graph [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
This causes <b>emerge</b> to consider the deep dependencies of all packages from the world set. With this option enabled,  <b>emerge</b> will bail out if it determines that the given operation will break any dependencies of the packages that have been added to the graph. Like the  <b>--deep</b> option, the <b>--complete-graph</b> option will significantly increase the time taken for dependency calculations. Note that, unlike the  <b>--deep</b> option, the  <b>--complete-graph</b> option does not cause any more packages to be updated than would have otherwise been updated with the option disabled. Using  <b>--with-bdeps=y</b> together with <b>--complete-graph</b> makes the graph as complete as possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--complete-graph-if-new-use &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
Trigger the <b>--complete-graph</b> behavior if USE or IUSE will change for an installed package. This option is enabled by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--complete-graph-if-new-ver &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
Trigger the <b>--complete-graph</b> behavior if an installed package version will change (upgrade or downgrade). This option is enabled by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--config-root=DIR</b></dt>
<dd>
Set the <b>PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT</b> environment variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--debug </b>(<b>-d</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to run the emerge command in <b>--debug</b> mode.  In this mode the bash build environment will run with the -x option, causing it to output verbose debugging information to stdout.  This also enables a plethora of other output (mostly dependency resolution messages).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--deep [DEPTH] </b>(<b>-D</b>)</dt>
<dd>
This flag forces  <b>emerge</b> to consider the entire dependency tree of packages, instead of checking only the immediate dependencies of the packages. As an example, this catches updates in libraries that are not directly listed in the dependencies of a package.  Also see  <b>--with-bdeps</b> for behavior with respect to build time dependencies that are not strictly required.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--depclean-lib-check [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Account for library link-level dependencies during  <b>--depclean</b> and <b>--prune</b> actions. This option is enabled by default. If FEATURES=&quot;preserve-libs&quot; is enabled in  <b>make.conf</b>(5), and preserve-libs is not restricted for any of the packages selected for removal, then this option is ignored because any libraries that have consumers will simply be preserved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--digest</b></dt>
<dd>
Prevent corruption from being noticed. The `repoman manifest` command is the preferred way to generate manifests and it is capable of doing an entire repository or category at once (see  <b>repoman</b>(1)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--dynamic-deps &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
In dependency calculations, substitute the dependencies of installed packages with the dependencies of corresponding unbuilt ebuilds from source repositories. This causes the effective dependencies of installed packages to vary dynamically when source ebuild dependencies are modified. This option is enabled by default.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>WARNING:</b> If you want to disable --dynamic-deps, then it may be necessary to first run  <b>fixpackages</b>(1) in order to get the best results. The  <b>fixpackages</b>(1) command performs two different operations that can also be performed separately by the `emaint --fix moveinst` and `emaint --fix movebin` commands (see  <b>emaint</b>(1)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--emptytree </b>(<b>-e</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Reinstalls target atoms and their entire deep dependency tree, as though no packages are currently installed. You should run this with  <b>--pretend</b> first to make sure the result is what you expect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--exclude </b>ATOMS</dt>
<dd>
A space separated list of package names or slot atoms. Emerge won't  install any ebuild or binary package that matches any of the given package atoms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--fail-clean [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Clean up temporary files after a build failure. This is particularly useful if you have  <b>PORTAGE_TMPDIR</b> on tmpfs. If this option is enabled, you probably also want to enable  <b>PORT_LOGDIR</b> (see <b>make.conf</b>(5)) in order to save the build log.</dd>

<b>--getbinpkg [ y | n ] (-g short option)</b></dt>
<dd>
Using the server and location defined in <i>PORTAGE_BINHOST</i> (see  <b>make.conf</b>(5)), portage will download the information from each binary package found and it will use that information to help build the dependency list.  This option implies  <b>-k</b>.  (Use <b>-gK</b> for binary-only merging.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--getbinpkgonly [ y | n ] (-G short option)</b></dt>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>--ignore-built-slot-operator-deps &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
Ignore the slot/sub-slot := operator parts of dependencies that have been recorded when packages where built. This option is intended only for debugging purposes, and it only affects built packages that specify slot/sub-slot := operator dependencies which are supported beginning with  <b>EAPI 5</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--ignore-soname-deps &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
Ignore the soname dependencies of binary and installed packages. This option is enabled by default, since soname dependencies are relatively new, and the required metadata is not guaranteed to exist for binary and installed packages built with older versions of portage. Also, soname dependencies will be automatically ignored for dependency calculations that can pull unbuilt ebuilds into the dependency graph, since unbuilt ebuilds do not have any soname dependency metadata, making it impossible to determine whether an unresolved soname dependency can be satisfied. Therefore,  <b>--usepkgonly</b> (or <b>--getbinpkgonly</b>) must be used in order to enable soname depedency resolution when installing packages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-j [JOBS], --jobs[=JOBS]</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the number of packages to build simultaneously. If this option is given without an argument, emerge will not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously. Also see the related  <b>--load-average</b> option. Similarly to the --quiet-build option, the --jobs option causes all build output to be redirected to logs. Note that interactive packages currently force a setting of  <i>--jobs=1</i>. This issue can be temporarily avoided by specifying  <i>--accept-properties=-interactive</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--keep-going [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Continue as much as possible after an error. When an error occurs, dependencies are recalculated for remaining packages and any with unsatisfied dependencies are automatically dropped. Also see the related  <b>--skipfirst</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--load-average [LOAD]</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies that no new builds should be started if there are other builds running and the load average is at least LOAD (a floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous load limit. This option is recommended for use in combination with  <b>--jobs</b> in order to avoid excess load. See  <b>make</b>(1) for information about analogous options that should be configured via  <b>MAKEOPTS</b> in  <b>make.conf</b>(5).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--misspell-suggestions &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable or disable misspell suggestions. By default, emerge will show a list of packages with similar names when a package doesn't exist. The  <i>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</i> variable may be used to disable this option by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--newrepo </b></dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to recompile a package if it is now being pulled from a different repository. This option also implies the  <b>--selective</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--newuse </b>(<b>-N</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to include installed packages where USE flags have changed since compilation. This option also implies the  <b>--selective</b> option. USE flag changes include:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A USE flag was added to a package. A USE flag was removed from a package. A USE flag was turned on for a package. A USE flag was turned off for a package.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
USE flags may be toggled by your profile as well as your USE and package.use settings. If you would like to skip rebuilds for which disabled flags have been added to or removed from IUSE, see the related  <b>--changed-use</b> option. If you would like to skip rebuilds for specific packages, see the  <b>--exclude</b> option.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
NOTE: This option ignores the state of the &quot;test&quot; USE flag, since that flag has a special binding to FEATURES=&quot;test&quot; (see  <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about  <b>FEATURES</b> settings).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--noconfmem</b></dt>
<dd>
Causes portage to disregard merge records indicating that a config file inside of a  <b>CONFIG_PROTECT</b> directory has been merged already.  Portage will normally merge those files only once to prevent the user from dealing with the same config multiple times.  This flag will cause the file to always be merged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--nodeps </b>(<b>-O</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Merges specified packages without merging any dependencies.  Note that the build may fail if the dependencies aren't satisfied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--noreplace </b>(<b>-n</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Skips the packages specified on the command-line that have already been installed.  Without this option, any package atoms or package sets you specify on the command-line  <b>will</b> cause Portage to remerge the package, even if it is already installed.  Note that Portage will not remerge dependencies by default. This option can be used to update the world file without rebuilding the packages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--nospinner</b></dt>

<dd>
Only merge (or pretend to merge) the dependencies of the packages specified, not the packages themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--package-moves [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Perform package moves when necessary. This option is enabled by default. Package moves are typically applied immediately after a  <b>--sync</b> action. They are applied in an incremental fashion, using only the subset of the history of package moves which have been added or modified since the previous application of package moves.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>WARNING:</b> This option should remain enabled under normal circumstances. Do not disable it unless you know what you are doing.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>--quiet-build [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Redirect all build output to logs alone, and do not display it on stdout. If a build failure occurs for a single package, the build log will be automatically displayed on stdout (unless the  <i>--quiet-fail</i> option is enabled). If there are multiple build failures (due to options like --keep-going or --jobs), then the content of the log files will not be displayed, and instead the paths of the log files will be displayed together with the corresponding die messages. Note that interactive packages currently force all build output to be displayed on stdout. This issue can be temporarily avoided by specifying  <i>--accept-properties=-interactive</i>. Further, note that disabling  <i>--quiet-build</i> has no effect if  <i>--jobs</i> is set to anything higher than 1.</dd>

<dt>
<b>--rebuild-if-new-slot [ y | n ]</b></dt>
<dd>
Automatically rebuild or reinstall packages when slot/sub-slot := operator dependencies can be satisfied by a newer slot, so that older packages slots will become eligible for removal by the --depclean action as soon as possible. This option only affects packages that specify slot/sub-slot := dependencies which are supported beginning with  <b>EAPI 5</b>. Since this option requires checking of reverse dependencies, it enables --complete-graph mode whenever a new slot is installed. This option is enabled by default.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
NOTE: If you want to skip all rebuilds involving slot-operator dependecies (including those that involve sub-slot changes alone), then  <i>--ignore-built-slot-operator-deps=y</i> is the option that you are looking for, since  <i>--rebuild-if-new-slot</i> does not affect rebuilds triggered by sub-slot changes alone.</dd>

This option is only meaningful when used together with  <b>ROOT</b> and it should not be enabled under normal circumstances!<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Does not affect EAPIs that support <b>HDEPEND</b>. Experimental  <b>EAPI 5-hdepend</b> provides <b>HDEPEND</b> as a new means to adjust installation into &quot; <i>/</i>&quot; and <b>ROOT</b>.

<b>--search-index &lt; y | n &gt;</b></dt>
<dd>
Enable or disable indexed search for search actions. This option is enabled by default. The search index needs to be regenerated by  <b>egencache</b>(1) after changes are made to a repository (see the  <b>--update-pkg-desc-index</b> action). This setting can be added to  <b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> (see <b>make.conf</b>(5)) and later overridden via the command line.</dd>

Restrict sync to the specified submodule(s). This option may be specified multiple times, in order to sync multiple submodules. Currently, this option has no effect for sync protocols other than rsync. (--sync action only)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--tree </b>(<b>-t</b>)</dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--unordered-display</b></dt>
<dd>
By default the displayed merge list is sorted using the order in which the packages will be merged. When  <b>--tree</b> is used together with this option, this constraint is removed, hopefully leading to a more readable dependency tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--update </b>(<b>-u</b>)</dt>
<dd>
Updates packages to the best version available, which may not always be the  highest version number due to masking for testing and development. Package atoms specified on the command line are greedy, meaning that unspecific atoms may match multiple versions of slotted packages.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>--usepkg [ y | n ] (-k short option)</b></dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to use binary packages (from $PKGDIR) if they are available, thus possibly avoiding some time-consuming compiles.  This option is useful for CD installs; you can export PKGDIR=/mnt/cdrom/packages and then use this option to have emerge &quot;pull&quot; binary packages from the CD in order to satisfy dependencies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--usepkgonly [ y | n ] (-K short option)</b></dt>
<dd>
Tells emerge to only use binary packages (from $PKGDIR).  All the binary packages must be available at the time of dependency calculation or emerge will simply abort.  Portage does not use ebuild repositories when calculating dependency information so all masking information is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>--verbose [ y | n ] (-v short option)</b></dt>
<dd>
Tell emerge to run in verbose mode.  Currently this flag causes emerge to print out GNU info errors, if any, and to show the USE flags that will be used for each package when pretending. The following symbols are affixed to USE flags in order to indicate their status:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<b>[ebuild UD] media-libs/libgd-1.8.4 [2.0.11]</b></dt>
<dd>
Libgd 2.0.11 is already emerged, but if you run the command, then portage will Downgrade to version 1.8.4 for you.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This may occur if a newer version of a package has been masked because it is broken or it creates a security risk on your system and a fix has not been released yet.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Another reason this may occur is if a package you are trying to emerge requires an older version of a package in order to emerge successfully.  In this case, libgd 2.x is incompatible with libgd 1.x.  This means that packages that were created with libgd 1.x will not compile with 2.x and must downgrade libgd first before they can emerge.</dd>

Here we see that the make.conf variable <b>USE</b> affects how this package is built.  In this example, ipv6 optional support is enabled and both gtk and qt support are disabled.  The asterisk following ipv6 indicates that ipv6 support was disabled the last time this package was installed.  The percent sign following qt indicates that the qt option has been added to the package since it was last installed.  For information about all  <b>USE</b> symbols, see the  <b>--verbose</b> option documentation above.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<h1>NOTES</h1> You should almost always precede any package install or update attempt with a  <b>--pretend</b> install or update.  This lets you see how much will be done, and shows you any blocking packages that you will have to rectify. This goes doubly so for the  <b>system</b> and <b>world</b> sets, which can update a large number of packages if the portage tree has been particularly active.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You also want to typically use <b>--update</b>, which ignores packages that are already fully updated but updates those that are not.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When you install a package with uninstalled dependencies and do not explicitly state those dependencies in the list of parameters, they will not be added to the world file.  If you want them to be detected for world updates, make sure to explicitly list them as parameters to  <b>emerge</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>USE variables</b> may be specified on the command line to override those specified in the default locations, letting you avoid using some dependencies you may not want to have.   <b>USE</b>  <b>flags specified on the command line are NOT remembered</b>.  For example,  <b>env USE=&quot;-X -gnome&quot; emerge mc</b> will emerge mc with those USE settings (on Bourne-compatible shells you may omit the  <b>env</b> part).  If you want those USE settings to be more permanent, you can put them in /etc/portage/package.use instead.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <b>emerge --update @system</b> or <b>emerge --update @world</b> fails with an error message, it may be that an ebuild uses some newer feature not present in this version of  <b>emerge</b>.  You can use  <b>emerge --update portage</b> to upgrade to the lastest version, which should support any necessary new features.</div>

<h1>MASKED PACKAGES</h1>  <i>NOTE: Please use caution when using development packages.  Problems</i>  <i>and bugs resulting from misusing masked packages drains Gentoo</i>  <i>developer time.  Please be sure you are capable of handling any problems</i>  <i>that may ensue.</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Masks in <b>portage</b> have many uses: they allow a testing period where the packages can be used in live machines; they prevent the use of a package when it will fail; and they mask existing packages that are broken or could pose a security risk.  Read below to find out how to unmask in various cases.  Also note that if you give  <b>emerge</b> an ebuild, then all forms of masking will be ignored and  <b>emerge</b> will attempt to emerge the package.<dl>
<dt>
<b>backtracking</b></dt>
<dd>
When packages are masked for <b>backtracking</b>, it means that the dependency resolver has temporarily masked them in order to avoid dependency conflicts and/or unsatisfied dependencies. This type of mask is typically accompanied by a message about a missed package update which has been skipped in order to avoid dependency conflicts and/or unsatisfied dependencies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>package.mask</b></dt>

<dt>
<b>EAPI</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>EAPI</b> variable in an <b>ebuild</b>(5) file is used to mask packages that are not supported by the current version of portage. Packages masked by  <b>EAPI</b> can only be installed after portage has been upgraded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>KEYWORDS</b></dt>
<dd>
The <b>KEYWORDS</b> variable in an <b>ebuild</b> file is also used for masking a package still in testing.  There are architecture-specific keywords for each package that let  <b>portage</b> know which systems are compatible with the package.  Packages which compile on an architecture, but have not been proven to be &quot;stable&quot;, are masked with a tilde ( <b>~</b>) in front of the architecture name.   <b>emerge</b> examines the <b>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</b> environment variable to allow or disallow the emerging of a package masked by  <b>KEYWORDS</b>.  To inform <b>emerge</b> that it should build these 'testing' versions of packages, you should update your  <i>/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords</i> file to list the packages you want the &#180;testing&#180; version.  See  <b>portage</b>(5) for more information.</dd>

The <b>PROPERTIES</b> variable in an <b>ebuild</b> file can be used to mask packages based on properties restrictions.  <b>emerge</b> examines the  <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> environment variable to allow or disallow the emerging of a package masked by  <b>PROPERTIES</b>. See <b>make.conf</b>(5) for information about  <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b>, and see <b>portage</b>(5) for information about  <i>/etc/portage/package.properties</i>.

The <b>RESTRICT</b> variable in an <b>ebuild</b> file can be used to mask packages based on RESTRICT tokens.  <b>emerge</b> examines the  <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> environment variable to allow or disallow the emerging of a package masked by  <b>RESTRICT</b>. See <b>make.conf</b>(5) for information about  <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b>, and see <b>portage</b>(5) for information about  <i>/etc/portage/package.accept_restrict</i>.

<div class="section">
<h1>CONFIGURATION FILES</h1> Portage has a special feature called &quot;config file protection&quot;. The purpose of this feature is to prevent new package installs from clobbering existing configuration files. By default, config file protection is turned on for /etc and the KDE configuration dirs; more may be added in the future.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When Portage installs a file into a protected directory tree like /etc, any existing files will not be overwritten. If a file of the same name already exists, Portage will change the name of the to-be-installed file from 'foo' to &#180;._cfg0000_foo&#180;. If &#180;._cfg0000_foo&#180; already exists, this name becomes &#180;._cfg0001_foo&#180;, etc. In this way, existing files are not overwritten, allowing the administrator to manually merge the new config files and avoid any unexpected changes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition to protecting overwritten files, Portage will not delete any files from a protected directory when a package is unmerged. While this may be a little bit untidy, it does prevent potentially valuable config files from being deleted, which is of paramount importance.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Protected directories are set using the <i>CONFIG_PROTECT</i> variable, normally defined in make.globals. Directory exceptions to the CONFIG_PROTECTed directories can be specified using the  <i>CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK</i> variable. To find files that need to be updated in /etc, type  <b>find /etc -name</b>  <b>'._cfg????_*'</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
You can disable this feature by setting <i>CONFIG_PROTECT=&quot;-*&quot;</i> in  <b>make.conf</b>(5). Then, Portage will mercilessly auto-update your config files. Alternatively, you can leave Config File Protection on but tell Portage that it can overwrite files in certain specific /etc subdirectories. For example, if you wanted Portage to automatically update your rc scripts and your wget configuration, but didn't want any other changes made without your explicit approval, you'd add this to  <b>make.conf</b>(5):<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK=&quot;/etc/wget /etc/rc.d&quot;</i><div class="spacer">
</div>
Tools such as dispatch-conf, cfg-update, and etc-update are also available to aid in the merging of these files. They provide interactive merging and can auto-merge trivial changes.</div>
