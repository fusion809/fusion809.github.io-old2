<h1>NAME</h1> atexit &#8212; register a function to run at process termination</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int atexit(void (*<i>func</i>)(void));<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&#160;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO&#160;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 defers to the ISO&#160;C standard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>atexit</i>() function shall register the function pointed to by <i>func</i>, to be called without arguments at normal program termination. At normal program termination, all functions registered by the  <i>atexit</i>() function shall be called, in the reverse order of their registration, except that a function is called after any previously registered functions that had already been called at the time it was registered. Normal termination occurs either by a call to  <i>exit</i>() or a return from  <i>main</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
At least 32 functions can be registered with  <i>atexit</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
After a successful call to any of the <i>exec</i> functions, any functions previously registered by  <i>atexit</i>() shall no longer be registered.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion,  <i>atexit</i>() shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> No errors are defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The functions registered by a call to  <i>atexit</i>() must return to ensure that all registered functions are called.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The application should call  <i>sysconf</i>() to obtain the value of {ATEXIT_MAX}, the number of functions that can be registered. There is no way for an application to tell how many functions have already been registered with  <i>atexit</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
Since the behavior is undefined if the  <i>exit</i>() function is called more than once, portable applications calling  <i>atexit</i>() must ensure that the  <i>exit</i>() function is not called at normal process termination when all functions registered by the  <i>atexit</i>() function are called.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All functions registered by the  <i>atexit</i>() function are called at normal process termination, which occurs by a call to the  <i>exit</i>() function or a return from  <i>main</i>() or on the last thread termination, when the behavior is as if the implementation called  <i>exit</i>() with a zero argument at thread termination time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If, at normal process termination, a function registered by the  <i>atexit</i>() function is called and a portable application needs to stop further  <i>exit</i>() processing, it must call the  <i>_exit</i>() function or the  <i>_Exit</i>() function or one of the functions which cause abnormal process termination.</div>
