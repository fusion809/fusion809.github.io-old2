<h1>NAME</h1> pclose &#8212; close a pipe stream to or from a process</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int pclose(FILE *<i>stream</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>pclose</i>() function shall close a stream that was opened by  <i>popen</i>(), wait for the command to terminate, and return the termination status of the process that was running the command language interpreter. However, if a call caused the termination status to be unavailable to  <i>pclose</i>(), then  <i>pclose</i>() shall return &#8722;1 with <i>errno</i> set to <b>[ECHILD]</b> to report this situation. This can happen if the application calls one of the following functions:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
<i>wait</i>()</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
<i>waitpid</i>() with a <i>pid</i> argument less than or equal to 0 or equal to the process ID of the command line interpreter</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
Any other function not defined in this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 that could do one of the above</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In any case,  <i>pclose</i>() shall not return before the child process created by  <i>popen</i>() has terminated.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the command language interpreter cannot be executed, the child termination status returned by  <i>pclose</i>() shall be as if the command language interpreter terminated using <i>exit</i>(127) or <i>_exit</i>(127).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>pclose</i>() function shall not affect the termination status of any child of the calling process other than the one created by  <i>popen</i>() for the associated stream.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the argument <i>stream</i> to  <i>pclose</i>() is not a pointer to a stream created by  <i>popen</i>(), the result of  <i>pclose</i>() is undefined.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful return,  <i>pclose</i>() shall return the termination status of the command language interpreter. Otherwise,  <i>pclose</i>() shall return &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>pclose</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>ECHILD</b></dt>
<dd>
The status of the child process could not be obtained, as described above.</dd>
</dl>

<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> There is a requirement that  <i>pclose</i>() not return before the child process terminates. This is intended to disallow implementations that return <b>[EINTR]</b> if a signal is received while waiting. If  <i>pclose</i>() returned before the child terminated, there would be no way for the application to discover which child used to be associated with the stream, and it could not do the cleanup itself.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the stream pointed to by <i>stream</i> was not created by  <i>popen</i>(), historical implementations of  <i>pclose</i>() return &#8722;1 without setting <i>errno</i>. To avoid requiring  <i>pclose</i>() to set <i>errno</i> in this case, POSIX.1&#8208;2008 makes the behavior unspecified. An application should not use  <i>pclose</i>() to close any stream that was not created by  <i>popen</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some historical implementations of  <i>pclose</i>() either block or ignore the signals SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGHUP while waiting for the child process to terminate. Since this behavior is not described for the  <i>pclose</i>() function in POSIX.1&#8208;2008, such implementations are not conforming. Also, some historical implementations return <b>[EINTR]</b> if a signal is received, even though the child process has not terminated. Such implementations are also considered non-conforming.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Consider, for example, an application that uses:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>popen(&quot;command&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
to start <i>command</i>, which is part of the same application. The parent writes a prompt to its standard output (presumably the terminal) and then reads from the  <i>popen</i>()ed stream. The child reads the response from the user, does some transformation on the response (pathname expansion, perhaps) and writes the result to its standard output. The parent process reads the result from the pipe, does something with it, and prints another prompt. The cycle repeats. Assuming that both processes do appropriate buffer flushing, this would be expected to work.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To conform to POSIX.1&#8208;2008,  <i>pclose</i>() must use  <i>waitpid</i>(), or some similar function, instead of  <i>wait</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
The code sample below illustrates how the  <i>pclose</i>() function might be implemented on a system conforming to POSIX.1&#8208;2008.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>int pclose(FILE *stream)</b><br/>
<b>{</b><br/>
<b>    int stat;</b><br/>
<b>    pid_t pid;</b><div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
    pid = &lt;pid for process created for stream by popen()&gt;<br/>
    (void) fclose(stream);<br/>
    while (waitpid(pid, &amp;stat, 0) == -1) {<br/>
        if (errno != EINTR){<br/>
            stat = -1;<br/>
            break;<br/>
        }<br/>
    }<br/>
    return(stat);<br/>
}<br/>
