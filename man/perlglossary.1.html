<h2>A</h2><dl>
<dt>
accessor methods</dt>
<dd>
A <b>method</b> used to indirectly inspect or update an  <b>object</b>Xs state (its <b>instance</b>  <b>variables</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
actual arguments</dt>
<dd>
The <b>scalar values</b> that you supply to a  <b>function</b> or <b>subroutine</b> when you call it. For instance, when you call &quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;, the string &quot;puff&quot; is the actual argument. See also  <b>argument</b> and <b>formal arguments</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
address operator</dt>
<dd>
Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of values, but this can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves for handling all memory management. The closest to an address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you a  <b>hard reference</b>, which is much safer than a memory address.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
algorithm</dt>
<dd>
A well-defined sequence of steps, explained clearly enough that even a computer could do them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
alias</dt>
<dd>
A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as though youXd used the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary aliases are implicitly created in the loop variable for &quot;foreach&quot; loops, in the $_ variable for &quot;map&quot; or &quot;grep&quot; operators, in $a and $b during &quot;sort&quot;Xs comparison function, and in each element of @_ for the  <b>actual arguments</b> of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are explicitly created in  <b>packages</b> by <b>importing</b> symbols or by assignment to  <b>typeglobs</b>. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables are explicitly created by the &quot;our&quot; declaration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
alphabetic</dt>
<dd>
The sort of characters we put into words. In Unicode, this is all letters including all ideographs and certain diacritics, letter numbers like Roman numerals, and various combining marks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
alternatives</dt>
<dd>
A list of possible choices from which you may select only one, as in, XWould you like door A, B, or C?X Alternatives in regular expressions are separated with a single vertical bar: &quot;|&quot;. Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with a double vertical bar: &quot;||&quot;. Logical alternatives in  <b>Boolean</b> expressions are separated with either &quot;||&quot; or &quot;or&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
anonymous</dt>
<dd>
Used to describe a <b>referent</b> that is not directly accessible through a named  <b>variable</b>. Such a referent must be indirectly accessible through at least one  <b>hard reference</b>. When the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous referent is destroyed without pity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
application</dt>
<dd>
A bigger, fancier sort of <b>program</b> with a fancier name so people donXt realize they are using a program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
architecture</dt>
<dd>
The kind of computer youXre working on, where one Xkind of computerX means all those computers sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the architecture itXs running on than programs in other languages, such as C, that are  <b>compiled</b> into machine code. See also  <b>platform</b> and <b>operating system</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
argument</dt>
<dd>
A piece of data supplied to a <b>program</b>,  <b>subroutine</b>, <b>function</b>, or <b>method</b> to tell it what itXs supposed to do. Also called a XparameterX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
ARGV</dt>
<dd>
The name of the array containing the <b>argument</b> <b>vector</b> from the command line. If you use the empty &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator, &quot;ARGV&quot; is the name of both the  <b>filehandle</b> used to traverse the arguments and the  <b>scalar</b> containing the name of the current input file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
arithmetical operator</dt>
<dd>
A <b>symbol</b> such as &quot;+&quot; or &quot;/&quot; that tells Perl to do the arithmetic you were supposed to learn in grade school.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
array</dt>
<dd>
An ordered sequence of <b>values</b>, stored such that you can easily access any of the values using an  <i>integer subscript</i> that specifies the valueXs  <b>offset</b> in the sequence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
array context</dt>
<dd>
An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to as  <b>list context</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Artistic License</dt>
<dd>
The open source license that Larry Wall created for Perl, maximizing PerlXs usefulness, availability, and modifiability. The current version is 2. (&lt;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php&gt;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
ASCII</dt>
<dd>
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (a 7-bit character set adequate only for poorly representing English text). Often used loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the various ISO-8859-X character sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes best described as half ASCII. See also  <b>Unicode</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
assertion</dt>
<dd>
A component of a <b>regular expression</b> that must be true for the pattern to match but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often used specifically to mean a  <b>zero-width</b> assertion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
assignment</dt>
<dd>
An <b>operator</b> whose assigned mission in life is to change the value of a  <b>variable</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
assignment operator</dt>
<dd>
Either a regular <b>assignment</b> or a compound  <b>operator</b> composed of an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that changes the value of a variable in place; that is, relative to its old value. For example, &quot;$a += 2&quot; adds 2 to $a.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
associative array</dt>
<dd>
See <b>hash</b>. Please. The term associative array is the old Perl 4 term for a  <b>hash</b>. Some languages call it a dictionary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
associativity</dt>
<dd>
Determines whether you do the left <b>operator</b> first or the right  <b>operator</b> first when you have XA <b>operator</b> B <b>operator</b> CX, and the two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like &quot;+&quot; are left associative, while operators like &quot;**&quot; are right associative. See Camel chapter 3, XUnary and Binary OperatorsX for a list of operators and their associativity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
asynchronous</dt>
<dd>
Said of events or activities whose relative temporal ordering is indeterminate because too many things are going on at once. Hence, an asynchronous event is one you didnXt know when to expect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
atom</dt>
<dd>
A <b>regular expression</b> component potentially matching a  <b>substring</b> containing one or more characters and treated as an indivisible syntactic unit by any following  <b>quantifier</b>. (Contrast with an  <b>assertion</b> that matches something of <b>zero width</b> and may not be quantified.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
atomic operation</dt>
<dd>
When Democritus gave the word XatomX to the indivisible bits of matter, he meant literally something that could not be cut:  <i>X-</i> (not) +  <i>-XXXXX</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that canXt be interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
attribute</dt>
<dd>
A new feature that allows the declaration of  <b>variables</b> and <b>subroutines</b> with modifiers, as in &quot;sub foo : locked method&quot;. Also another name for an  <b>instance variable</b> of an <b>object</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
autogeneration</dt>
<dd>
A feature of <b>operator overloading</b> of <b>objects</b>, whereby the behavior of certain  <b>operators</b> can be reasonably deduced using more fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators will often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See Camel chapter 13, XOverloadingX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
autoincrement</dt>
<dd>
To add one to something automatically, hence the name of the &quot;++&quot; operator. To instead subtract one from something automatically is known as an XautodecrementX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
autoload</dt>
<dd>
To load on demand. (Also called XlazyX loading.) Specifically, to call an &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subroutine on behalf of an undefined subroutine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
autosplit</dt>
<dd>
To split a string automatically, as the <i>Xa</i> <b>switch</b> does when running under  <i>Xp</i> or <i>Xn</i> in order to emulate <b>awk</b>. (See also the &quot;AutoSplit&quot; module, which has nothing to do with the &quot;Xa&quot; switch but a lot to do with autoloading.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
autovivification</dt>
<dd>
A Graeco-Roman word meaning Xto bring oneself to lifeX. In Perl, storage locations ( <b>lvalues</b>) spontaneously generate themselves as needed, including the creation of any  <b>hard reference</b> values to point to the next level of storage. The assignment &quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] = &quot;quintet&quot;&quot; potentially creates five scalar storage locations, plus four references (in the first four scalar locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar locations). But the point of autovivification is that you donXt have to worry about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
AV</dt>
<dd>
Short for Xarray valueX, which refers to one of PerlXs internal data types that holds an  <b>array</b>. The &quot;AV&quot; type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
awk</dt>
<dd>
Descriptive editing termXshort for XawkwardX. Also coincidentally refers to a venerable text-processing language from which Perl derived some of its high-level ideas.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>B</h2><dl>
<dt>
backreference</dt>
<dd>
A substring <b>captured</b> by a subpattern within unadorned parentheses in a  <b>regex</b>. Backslashed decimal numbers (&quot;\1&quot;, &quot;\2&quot;, etc.) later in the same pattern refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside the pattern, the numbered variables ($1, $2, etc.) continue to refer to these same values, as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the current  <b>dynamic scope</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
backtracking</dt>
<dd>
The practice of saying, XIf I had to do it all over, IXd do it differently,X and then actually going back and doing it all over differently. Mathematically speaking, itXs returning from an unsuccessful recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to match patterns with a  <b>regular expression</b>, and its earlier attempts donXt pan out. See the section XThe Little Engine That /Couldn(nXt)X in Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
backward compatibility</dt>
<dd>
Means you can still run your old program because we didnXt break any of the features or bugs it was relying on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bareword</dt>
<dd>
A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under &quot;use strict 'subs'&quot;. In the absence of that stricture, a bareword is treated as if quotes were around it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
base class</dt>
<dd>
A generic <b>object</b> type; that is, a <b>class</b> from which other, more specific classes are derived genetically by  <b>inheritance</b>. Also called a XsuperclassX by people who respect their ancestors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
big-endian</dt>
<dd>
From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end first. Also used of computers that store the most significant  <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte address than the least significant byte. Often considered superior to little-endian machines. See also  <b>little-endian</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
binary</dt>
<dd>
Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means thereXs basically two numbers: 0 and 1. Also used to describe a file of XnontextX, presumably because such a file makes full use of all the binary bits in its bytes. With the advent of  <b>Unicode</b>, this distinction, already suspect, loses even more of its meaning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
binary operator</dt>
<dd>
An <b>operator</b> that takes two <b>operands</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bind</dt>
<dd>
To assign a specific <b>network address</b> to a <b>socket</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bit</dt>
<dd>
An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest possible unit of information storage. An eighth of a  <b>byte</b> or of a dollar. (The term XPieces of EightX comes from being able to split the old Spanish dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money. ThatXs why a 25- cent piece today is still Xtwo bitsX.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bit shift</dt>
<dd>
The movement of bits left or right in a computer word, which has the effect of multiplying or dividing by a power of 2.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bit string</dt>
<dd>
A sequence of <b>bits</b> that is actually being thought of as a sequence of bits, for once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bless</dt>
<dd>
In corporate life, to grant official approval to a thing, as in, XThe VP of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher project.X Similarly, in Perl, to grant official approval to a  <b>referent</b> so that it can function as an <b>object</b>, such as a WebCruncher object. See the &quot;bless&quot; function in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
block</dt>
<dd>
What a <b>process</b> does when it has to wait for something: XMy process blocked waiting for the disk.X As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large chunk of data, of a size that the  <b>operating system</b> likes to deal with (normally a power of 2 such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to a chunk of data thatXs coming from or going to a disk file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
BLOCK</dt>
<dd>
A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of Perl  <b>statements</b> that is delimited by braces. The &quot;if&quot; and &quot;while&quot; statements are defined in terms of  <i></i><i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i><i></i>s, for instance. Sometimes we also say XblockX to mean a lexical scope; that is, a sequence of statements that acts like a  <i></i><i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i><i></i>, such as within an &quot;eval&quot; or a file, even though the statements arenXt delimited by braces.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
block buffering</dt>
<dd>
A method of making input and output efficient by passing one  <b>block</b> at a time. By default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See  <b>buffer</b> and <b>command buffering</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Boolean</dt>
<dd>
A value that is either <b>true</b> or  <b>false</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Boolean context</dt>
<dd>
A special kind of <b>scalar</b>  <b>context</b> used in conditionals to decide whether the <b>scalar value</b> returned by an expression is  <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. Does not evaluate as either a string or a number. See  <b>context</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
breakpoint</dt>
<dd>
A spot in your program where youXve told the debugger to stop  <b>execution</b> so you can poke around and see whether anything is wrong yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
broadcast</dt>
<dd>
To send a <b>datagram</b> to multiple destinations simultaneously.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
BSD</dt>
<dd>
A psychoactive drug, popular in the X80s, probably developed at UC Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the prescription-only medication called XSystem VX, but infinitely more useful. (Or, at least, more fun.) The full chemical name is XBerkeley Standard DistributionX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bucket</dt>
<dd>
A location in a <b>hash table</b> containing (potentially) multiple entries whose keys XhashX to the same hash value according to its hash function. (As internal policy, you donXt have to worry about it unless youXre into internals, or policy.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
buffer</dt>
<dd>
A temporary holding location for data. Data that are  <b>Block buffering</b> means that the data is passed on to its destination whenever the buffer is full.  <b>Line buffering</b> means that itXs passed on whenever a complete line is received.  <b>Command buffering</b> means that itXs passed every time you do a &quot;print&quot; command (or equivalent). If your output is unbuffered, the system processes it one byte at a time without the use of a holding area. This can be rather inefficient.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
built-in</dt>
<dd>
A <b>function</b> that is predefined in the language. Even when hidden by  <b>overriding</b>, you can always get at a built- in function by  <b>qualifying</b> its name with the &quot;CORE::&quot; pseudopackage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bundle</dt>
<dd>
A group of related modules on <b>CPAN</b>. (Also sometimes refers to a group of command-line switches grouped into one  <b>switch</b>  <b>cluster</b>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
byte</dt>
<dd>
A piece of data worth eight <b>bits</b> in most places.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
bytecode</dt>
<dd>
A pidgin-like lingo spoken among Xdroids when they donXt wish to reveal their orientation (see  <b>endian</b>). Named after some similar languages spoken (for similar reasons) between compilers and interpreters in the late 20XX century. These languages are characterized by representing everything as a nonarchitecture-dependent sequence of bytes.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>C</h2><dl>
<dt>
C</dt>
<dd>
A language beloved by many for its inside-out <b>type</b> definitions, inscrutable  <b>precedence</b> rules, and heavy <b>overloading</b> of the function-call mechanism. (Well, actually, people first switched to C because they found lowercase identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl is written in C, so itXs not surprising that Perl borrowed a few ideas from it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
cache</dt>
<dd>
A data repository. Instead of computing expensive answers several times, compute it once and save the result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
callback</dt>
<dd>
A <b>handler</b> that you register with some other part of your program in the hope that the other part of your program will  <b>trigger</b> your handler when some event of interest transpires.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
call by reference</dt>
<dd>
An <b>argument</b>-passing mechanism in which the <b>formal arguments</b> refer directly to the  <b>actual arguments</b>, and the <b>subroutine</b> can change the actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. That is, the formal argument is an  <b>alias</b> for the actual argument. See also <b>call by value</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
call by value</dt>
<dd>
An <b>argument</b>-passing mechanism in which the <b>formal</b>  <b>arguments</b> refer to a copy of the <b>actual arguments</b>, and the  <b>subroutine</b> cannot change the actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. See also  <b>call by reference</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
canonical</dt>
<dd>
Reduced to a standard form to facilitate comparison.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
capture variables</dt>
<dd>
The variablesXsuch as $1 and $2, and &quot;%+&quot; and %X Xthat hold the text remembered in a pattern match. See Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
capturing</dt>
<dd>
The use of parentheses around a <b>subpattern</b> in a  <b>regular expression</b> to store the matched <b>substring</b> as a  <b>backreference</b>. (Captured strings are also returned as a list in <b>list</b>  <b>context</b>.) See Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
cargo cult</dt>
<dd>
Copying and pasting code without understanding it, while superstitiously believing in its value. This term originated from preindustrial cultures dealing with the detritus of explorers and colonizers of technologically advanced cultures. See  <i>The Gods Must Be Crazy</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
case</dt>
<dd>
A property of certain characters. Originally, typesetter stored capital letters in the upper of two cases and small letters in the lower one. Unicode recognizes three cases:  <b>lowercase</b> (<b>character property</b> &quot;\p{lower}&quot;), <b>titlecase</b> (&quot;\p{title}&quot;), and  <b>uppercase</b> (&quot;\p{upper}&quot;). A fourth casemapping called  <b>foldcase</b> is not itself a distinct case, but it is used internally to implement  <b>casefolding</b>. Not all letters have case, and some nonletters have case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
casefolding</dt>
<dd>
Comparing or matching a string case-insensitively. In Perl, it is implemented with the &quot;/i&quot; pattern modifier, the &quot;fc&quot; function, and the &quot;\F&quot; double-quote translation escape.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
casemapping</dt>
<dd>
The process of converting a string to one of the four Unicode  <b>casemaps</b>; in Perl, it is implemented with the &quot;fc&quot;, &quot;lc&quot;, &quot;ucfirst&quot;, and &quot;uc&quot; functions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
character</dt>
<dd>
The smallest individual element of a string. Computers store characters as integers, but Perl lets you operate on them as text. The integer used to represent a particular character is called that characterXs  <b>codepoint</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
character class</dt>
<dd>
A square-bracketed list of characters used in a  <b>regular expression</b> to indicate that any character of the set may occur at a given point. Loosely, any predefined set of characters so used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
character property</dt>
<dd>
A predefined <b>character class</b> matchable by the &quot;\p&quot; or &quot;\P&quot;  <b>metasymbol</b>. <b>Unicode</b> defines hundreds of standard properties for every possible codepoint, and Perl defines a few of its own, too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
circumfix operator</dt>
<dd>
An <b>operator</b> that surrounds its <b>operand</b>, like the angle operator, or parentheses, or a hug.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
class</dt>
<dd>
A user-defined <b>type</b>, implemented in Perl via a  <b>package</b> that provides (either directly or by inheritance) <b>methods</b> (that is,  <b>subroutines</b>) to handle <b>instances</b> of the class (its  <b>objects</b>). See also <b>inheritance</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
class method</dt>
<dd>
A <b>method</b> whose <b>invocant</b> is a  <b>package</b> name, not an <b>object</b> reference. A method associated with the class as a whole. Also see  <b>instance method</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
client</dt>
<dd>
In networking, a <b>process</b> that initiates contact with a  <b>server</b> process in order to exchange data and perhaps receive a service.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
closure</dt>
<dd>
An <b>anonymous</b> subroutine that, when a reference to it is generated at runtime, keeps track of the identities of externally visible  <b>lexical variables</b>, even after those lexical variables have supposedly gone out of  <b>scope</b>. TheyXre called XclosuresX because this sort of behavior gives mathematicians a sense of closure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
cluster</dt>
<dd>
A parenthesized <b>subpattern</b> used to group parts of a  <b>regular expression</b> into a single <b>atom</b>.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
codepoint</dt>
<dd>
The integer a computer uses to represent a given character. ASCII codepoints are in the range 0 to 127; Unicode codepoints are in the range 0 to 0x1F_FFFF; and Perl codepoints are in the range 0 to 2XXX1 or 0 to 2XXX1, depending on your native integer size.

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
collating sequence</dt>
<dd>
The order into which <b>characters</b> sort. This is used by  <b>string</b> comparison routines to decide, for example, where in this glossary to put Xcollating sequenceX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
co-maintainer</dt>
<dd>
A person with permissions to index a <b>namespace</b> in  <b>PAUSE</b>. Anyone can upload any namespace, but only primary and co-maintainers get their contributions indexed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
combining character</dt>
<dd>
Any character with the General Category of Combining Mark (&quot;\p{GC=M}&quot;), which may be spacing or nonspacing. Some are even invisible.

Most but not all diacritics are combining characters, and vice versa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

command</dt>
<dd>
In <b>shell</b> programming, the syntactic combination of a program name and its arguments. More loosely, anything you type to a shell (a command interpreter) that starts it doing something. Even more loosely, a Perl  <b>statement</b>, which might start with a <b>label</b> and typically ends with a semicolon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
command buffering</dt>
<dd>
A mechanism in Perl that lets you store up the output of each Perl  <b>command</b> and then flush it out as a single request to the  <b>operating system</b>. ItXs enabled by setting the $| ($AUTOFLUSH) variable to a true value. ItXs used when you donXt want data sitting around, not going where itXs supposed to, which may happen because the default on a  <b>file</b> or <b>pipe</b> is to use <b>block buffering</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
command-line arguments</dt>
<dd>
The <b>values</b> you supply along with a program name when you tell a  <b>shell</b> to execute a <b>command</b>. These values are passed to a Perl program through @ARGV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
command name</dt>
<dd>
The name of the program currently executing, as typed on the command line. In C, the  <b>command</b> name is passed to the program as the first command-line argument. In Perl, it comes in separately as $0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
comment</dt>
<dd>
A remark that doesnXt affect the meaning of the program. In Perl, a comment is introduced by a &quot;#&quot; character and continues to the end of the line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
compilation unit</dt>
<dd>
The <b>file</b> (or <b>string</b>, in the case of &quot;eval&quot;) that is currently being  <b>compiled</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
compile</dt>
<dd>
The process of turning source code into a machine-usable form. See <b>compile</b>  <b>phase</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
compile phase</dt>
<dd>
Any time before Perl starts running your main program. See also  <b>run phase</b>. Compile phase is mostly spent in <b>compile</b>  <b>time</b>, but may also be spent in <b>runtime</b> when &quot;BEGIN&quot; blocks, &quot;use&quot; or &quot;no&quot; declarations, or constant subexpressions are being evaluated. The startup and import code of any &quot;use&quot; declaration is also run during compile phase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
compiler</dt>
<dd>
Strictly speaking, a program that munches up another program and spits out yet another file containing the program in a Xmore executableX form, typically containing native machine instructions. The  <i>perl</i> program is not a compiler by this definition, but it does contain a kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more executable form ( <b>syntax trees</b>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the  <b>interpreter</b> then interprets. There are, however, extension <b>modules</b> to get Perl to act more like a XrealX compiler. See Camel chapter 16, XCompilingX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
compile time</dt>
<dd>
The time when Perl is trying to make sense of your code, as opposed to when it thinks it knows what your code means and is merely trying to do what it thinks your code says to do, which is  <b>runtime</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
composer</dt>
<dd>
A XconstructorX for a <b>referent</b> that isnXt really an  <b>object</b>, like an anonymous array or a hash (or a sonata, for that matter). For example, a pair of braces acts as a composer for a hash, and a pair of brackets acts as a composer for an array. See the section XCreating ReferencesX in Camel chapter 8, XReferencesX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
concatenation</dt>
<dd>
The process of gluing one catXs nose to another catXs tail. Also a similar operation on two  <b>strings</b>.</dd>

Something XiffyX. See <b>Boolean context</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
connection</dt>
<dd>
In telephony, the temporary electrical circuit between the callerXs and the calleeXs phone. In networking, the same kind of temporary circuit between a  <b>client</b> and a <b>server</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
construct</dt>
<dd>
As a noun, a piece of syntax made up of smaller pieces. As a transitive verb, to create an  <b>object</b> using a <b>constructor</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
constructor</dt>
<dd>
Any <b>class method</b>, <b>instance</b>, or <b>subroutine</b> that composes, initializes, blesses, and returns an  <b>object</b>. Sometimes we use the term loosely to mean a  <b>composer</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
context</dt>
<dd>
The surroundings or environment. The context given by the surrounding code determines what kind of data a particular  <b>expression</b> is expected to return. The three primary contexts are  <b>list context</b>,  <b>scalar</b>, and <b>void context</b>. Scalar context is sometimes subdivided into  <b>Boolean context</b>, <b>numeric context</b>, <b>string context</b>, and <b>void</b>  <b>context</b>. ThereXs also a XdonXt careX context (which is dealt with in Camel chapter 2, XBits and PiecesX, if you care).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
continuation</dt>
<dd>
The treatment of more than one physical <b>line</b> as a single logical line.  <b>Makefile</b> lines are continued by putting a backslash before the  <b>newline</b>. Mail headers, as defined by RFC 822, are continued by putting a space or tab  <i>after</i> the newline. In general, lines in Perl do not need any form of continuation mark, because  <b>whitespace</b> (including newlines) is gleefully ignored. Usually.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
core dump</dt>
<dd>
The corpse of a <b>process</b>, in the form of a file left in the  <b>working directory</b> of the process, usually as a result of certain kinds of fatal errors.</dd>

C preprocessor</dt>
<dd>
The typical C compilerXs first pass, which processes lines beginning with &quot;#&quot; for conditional compilation and macro definition, and does various manipulations of the program text based on the current definitions. Also known as  <i>cpp</i>(1).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
cracker</dt>
<dd>
Someone who breaks security on computer systems. A cracker may be a true  <b>hacker</b> or only a <b>script kiddie</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
currently selected output channel</dt>
<dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
current package</dt>
<dd>
The <b>package</b> in which the current statement is  <b>compiled</b>. Scan backward in the text of your program through the current  <b>lexical scope</b> or any enclosing lexical scopes until you find a package declaration. ThatXs your current package name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
current working directory</dt>
<dd>
See <b>working directory</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
CV</dt>
<dd>
In academia, a curriculum vitae, a fancy kind of resume. In Perl, an internal Xcode valueX typedef holding a  <b>subroutine</b>. The &quot;CV&quot; type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>D</h2><dl>
<dt>
dangling statement</dt>
<dd>
A bare, single <b>statement</b>, without any braces, hanging off an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;while&quot; conditional. C allows them. Perl doesnXt.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
datagram</dt>
<dd>
A packet of data, such as a <b>UDP</b> message, that (from the viewpoint of the programs involved) can be sent independently over the network. (In fact, all packets are sent independently at the  <b>IP</b> level, but  <b>stream</b> protocols such as <b>TCP</b> hide this from your program.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
data structure</dt>
<dd>
How your various pieces of data relate to each other and what shape they make when you put them all together, as in a rectangular table or a triangular tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
data type</dt>
<dd>
A set of possible values, together with all the operations that know how to deal with those values. For example, a numeric data type has a certain set of numbers that you can work with, as well as various mathematical operations that you can do on the numbers, but would make little sense on, say, a string such as &quot;Kilroy&quot;. Strings have their own operations, such as  <b>concatenation</b>. Compound types made of a number of smaller pieces generally have operations to compose and decompose them, and perhaps to rearrange them.  <b>Objects</b> that model things in the real world often have operations that correspond to real activities. For instance, if you model an elevator, your elevator object might have an &quot;open_door&quot;  <b>method</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
DBM</dt>
<dd>
Stands for XDatabase ManagementX routines, a set of routines that emulate an  <b>associative array</b> using disk files. The routines use a dynamic hashing scheme to locate any entry with only two disk accesses. DBM files allow a Perl program to keep a persistent  <b>hash</b> across multiple invocations. You can &quot;tie&quot; your hash variables to various DBM implementations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
declaration</dt>
<dd>
An <b>assertion</b> that states something exists and perhaps describes what itXs like, without giving any commitment as to how or where youXll use it. A declaration is like the part of your recipe that says, Xtwo cups flour, one large egg, four or five tadpolesXX See  <b>statement</b> for its opposite. Note that some declarations also function as statements. Subroutine declarations also act as definitions if a body is supplied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
declarator</dt>
<dd>
Something that tells your program what sort of variable youXd like. Perl doesnXt require you to declare variables, but you can use &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;state&quot; to denote that you want something other than the default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
decrement</dt>
<dd>
To subtract a value from a variable, as in Xdecrement $xX (meaning to remove 1 from its value) or Xdecrement $x by 3X.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
default</dt>
<dd>
A <b>value</b> chosen for you if you donXt supply a value of your own.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
defined</dt>
<dd>
Having a meaning. Perl thinks that some of the things people try to do are devoid of meaning; in particular, making use of variables that have never been given a  <b>value</b> and performing certain operations on data that isnXt there. For example, if you try to read data past the end of a file, Perl will hand you back an undefined value. See also  <b>false</b> and the &quot;defined&quot; entry in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
delimiter</dt>
<dd>
A <b>character</b> or <b>string</b> that sets bounds to an arbitrarily sized textual object, not to be confused with a  <b>separator</b> or  <b>terminator</b>. XTo delimitX really just means Xto surroundX or Xto encloseX (like these parentheses are doing).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
dereference</dt>
<dd>
A fancy computer science term meaning Xto follow a  <b>reference</b> to what it points toX. The XdeX part of it refers to the fact that youXre taking away one level of  <b>indirection</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
derived class</dt>
<dd>
A <b>class</b> that defines some of its <b>methods</b> in terms of a more generic class, called a  <b>base class</b>. Note that classes arenXt classified exclusively into base classes or derived classes: a class can function as both a derived class and a base class simultaneously, which is kind of classy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
descriptor</dt>
<dd>
See <b>file descriptor</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
destroy</dt>
<dd>
To deallocate the memory of a <b>referent</b> (first triggering its &quot;DESTROY&quot; method, if it has one).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
destructor</dt>
<dd>
A special <b>method</b> that is called when an  <b>object</b> is thinking about <b>destroying</b> itself. A Perl programXs &quot;DESTROY&quot; method doesnXt do the actual destruction; Perl just  <b>triggers</b> the method in case the  <b>class</b> wants to do any associated cleanup.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
device</dt>
<dd>
A whiz-bang hardware gizmo (like a disk or tape drive or a modem or a joystick or a mouse) attached to your computer, which the  <b>operating system</b> tries to make look like a <b>file</b> (or a bunch of files). Under Unix, these fake files tend to live in the  <i>/dev</i> directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>

<dd>
A <b>pod</b> directive. See Camel chapter 23, XPlain Old DocumentationX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
directory</dt>
<dd>
A special file that contains other files. Some  <b>operating systems</b> call these XfoldersX, XdrawersX, XcataloguesX, or XcatalogsX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
directory handle</dt>
<dd>
A name that represents a particular instance of opening a directory to read it, until you close it. See the &quot;opendir&quot; function.</dd>

<dd>
Some people need this and some people avoid it. For Perl, itXs an old way to say  <b>I/O layer</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
dispatch</dt>
<dd>
To send something to its correct destination. Often used metaphorically to indicate a transfer of programmatic control to a destination selected algorithmically, often by lookup in a table of function  <b>references</b> or, in the case of object <b>methods</b>, by traversing the inheritance tree looking for the most specific definition for the method.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
distribution</dt>
<dd>
A standard, bundled release of a system of software. The default usage implies source code is included. If that is not the case, it will be called a Xbinary-onlyX distribution.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
dual-lived</dt>
<dd>
Some modules live both in the  <b>Standard Library</b> and on <b>CPAN</b>. These modules might be developed on two tracks as people modify either version. The trend currently is to untangle these situations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
dweomer</dt>
<dd>
An enchantment, illusion, phantasm, or jugglery. Said when PerlXs magical  <b>dwimmer</b> effects donXt do what you expect, but rather seem to be the product of arcane  <i>dweomercraft</i>, sorcery, or wonder working. [From Middle English.]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
dwimmer</dt>
<dd>
DWIM is an acronym for XDo What I MeanX, the principle that something should just do what you want it to do without an undue amount of fuss. A bit of code that does XdwimmingX is a XdwimmerX. Dwimming can require a great deal of behind-the-scenes magic, which (if it doesnXt stay properly behind the scenes) is called a  <b>dweomer</b> instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
dynamic scoping</dt>
<dd>
Dynamic scoping works over a <b>dynamic</b>  <b>scope</b>, making variables visible throughout the rest of the <b>block</b> in which they are first used and in any  <b>subroutines</b> that are called by the rest of the block. Dynamically scoped variables can have their values temporarily changed (and implicitly restored later) by a &quot;local&quot; operator. (Compare  <b>lexical scoping</b>.) Used more loosely to mean how a subroutine that is in the middle of calling another subroutine XcontainsX that subroutine at  <b>runtime</b>.</dd>

<dt>
fatal error</dt>
<dd>
An uncaught <b>exception</b>, which causes termination of the  <b>process</b> after printing a message on your <b>standard error</b> stream. Errors that happen inside an &quot;eval&quot; are not fatal. Instead, the &quot;eval&quot; terminates after placing the exception message in the $@ ($EVAL_ERROR) variable. You can try to provoke a fatal error with the &quot;die&quot; operator (known as throwing or raising an exception), but this may be caught by a dynamically enclosing &quot;eval&quot;. If not caught, the &quot;die&quot; becomes a fatal error.</dd>

field</dt>
<dd>
A single piece of numeric or string data that is part of a longer  <b>string</b>, <b>record</b>, or <b>line</b>. Variable-width fields are usually split up by  <b>separators</b> (so use &quot;split&quot; to extract the fields), while fixed-width fields are usually at fixed positions (so use &quot;unpack&quot;).  <b>Instance variables</b> are also known as XfieldsX.</dd>

<dt>
file</dt>
<dd>
A named collection of data, usually stored on disk in a  <b>directory</b> in a <b>filesystem</b>. Roughly like a document, if youXre into office metaphors. In modern filesystems, you can actually give a file more than one name. Some files have special properties, like directories and devices.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
file descriptor</dt>
<dd>
The little number the <b>operating</b>  <b>system</b> uses to keep track of which opened <b>file</b> youXre talking about. Perl hides the file descriptor inside a  <b>standard I/O</b> stream and then attaches the stream to a  <b>filehandle</b>.</dd>

fileglob</dt>
<dd>
A XwildcardX match on <b>filenames</b>. See the &quot;glob&quot; function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
filehandle</dt>
<dd>
An identifier (not necessarily related to the real name of a file) that represents a particular instance of opening a file, until you close it. If youXre going to open and close several different files in succession, itXs fine to open each of them with the same filehandle, so you donXt have to write out separate code to process each file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
filename</dt>
<dd>
One name for a file. This name is listed in a  <b>directory</b>. You can use it in an &quot;open&quot; to tell the <b>operating system</b> exactly which file you want to open, and associate the file with a  <b>filehandle</b>, which will carry the subsequent identity of that file in your program, until you close it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
filesystem</dt>
<dd>
A set of <b>directories</b> and <b>files</b> residing on a partition of the disk. Sometimes known as a XpartitionX. You can change the fileXs name or even move a file around from directory to directory within a filesystem without actually moving the file itself, at least under Unix.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
flag</dt>
<dd>
We tend to avoid this term because it means so many things. It may mean a command-line  <b>switch</b> that takes no argument itself (such as PerlXs &quot;Xn&quot; and &quot;Xp&quot; flags) or, less frequently, a single-bit indicator (such as the &quot;O_CREAT&quot; and &quot;O_EXCL&quot; flags used in &quot;sysopen&quot;). Sometimes informally used to refer to certain regex modifiers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
floating point</dt>
<dd>
A method of storing numbers in Xscientific notationX, such that the precision of the number is independent of its magnitude (the decimal point XfloatsX). Perl does its numeric work with floating-point numbers (sometimes called XfloatsX) when it canXt get away with using  <b>integers</b>. Floating-point numbers are mere approximations of real numbers.</dd>

formal arguments</dt>
<dd>
The generic names by which a  <b>subroutine</b> knows its <b>arguments</b>. In many languages, formal arguments are always given individual names; in Perl, the formal arguments are just the elements of an array. The formal arguments to a Perl program are $ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], and so on. Similarly, the formal arguments to a Perl subroutine are $_[0], $_[1], and so on. You may give the arguments individual names by assigning the values to a &quot;my&quot; list. See also  <b>actual arguments</b>.</dd>

garbage collection</dt>
<dd>
A misnamed featureXit should be called, Xexpecting your mother to pick up after youX. Strictly speaking, Perl doesnXt do this, but it relies on a reference-counting mechanism to keep things tidy. However, we rarely speak strictly and will often refer to the reference-counting scheme as a form of garbage collection.

In olden days, the act of looking up a <b>key</b> in an actual index (such as a phone book). But now it's merely the act of using any kind of key or position to find the corresponding  <b>value</b>, even if no index is involved.

In English grammar, a short noun phrase between a verb and its direct object indicating the beneficiary or recipient of the action. In Perl, &quot;print STDOUT &quot;$foo\n&quot;;&quot; can be understood as Xverb indirect-object objectX, where &quot;STDOUT&quot; is the recipient of the &quot;print&quot; action, and &quot;$foo&quot; is the object being printed.  Similarly, when invoking a  <b>method</b>, you might place the invocant in the dative slot between the method and its arguments:<div style="height: 1.00em;">

<dd>
The insertion of a scalar or list value somewhere in the middle of another value, such that it appears to have been there all along.

interpreter</dt>
<dd>
Strictly speaking, a program that reads a second program and does what the second program says directly without turning the program into a different form first, which is what  <b>compilers</b> do. Perl is not an interpreter by this definition, because it contains a kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more executable form ( <b>syntax trees</b>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the Perl  <b>runtime</b> system then interprets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
A relationship between two <b>objects</b> in which one object is considered to be a more specific version of the other, generic object: XA camel is a mammal.X Since the generic object really only exists in a Platonic sense, we usually add a little abstraction to the notion of objects and think of the relationship as being between a generic  <b>base</b>  <b>class</b> and a specific <b>derived class</b>.

line number</dt>
<dd>
The number of lines read previous to this one, plus 1. Perl keeps a separate line number for each source or input file it opens. The current source fileXs line number is represented by &quot;__LINE__&quot;. The current input line number (for the file that was most recently read via &quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;) is represented by the $. ($INPUT_LINE_NUMBER) variable.

memory</dt>
<dd>
This always means your main memory, not your disk. Clouding the issue is the fact that your machine may implement  <b>virtual</b> memory; that is, it will pretend that it has more memory than it really does, and itXll use disk space to hold inactive bits. This can make it seem like you have a little more memory than you really do, but itXs not a substitute for real memory. The best thing that can be said about virtual memory is that it lets your performance degrade gradually rather than suddenly when you run out of real memory. But your program can die when you run out of virtual memory, tooXif you havenXt thrashed your disk to death first.</dd>

operating system</dt>
<dd>
A special program that runs on the bare machine and hides the gory details of managing  <b>processes</b> and <b>devices</b>. Usually used in a looser sense to indicate a particular culture of programming. The loose sense can be used at varying levels of specificity. At one extreme, you might say that all versions of Unix and Unix-lookalikes are the same operating system (upsetting many people, especially lawyers and other advocates). At the other extreme, you could say this particular version of this particular vendorXs operating system is different from any other version of this or any other vendorXs operating system. Perl is much more portable across operating systems than many other languages. See also  <b>architecture</b> and <b>platform</b>.</dd>

<dd>
The art of defining something (at least partly) in terms of itself, which is a naughty no-no in dictionaries but often works out okay in computer programs if youXre careful not to recurse forever (which is like an infinite loop with more spectacular failure modes).</dd>

<dt>
regular expression</dt>
<dd>
A single entity with various interpretations, like an elephant. To a computer scientist, itXs a grammar for a little language in which some strings are legal and others arenXt. To normal people, itXs a pattern you can use to find what youXre looking for when it varies from case to case. PerlXs regular expressions are far from regular in the theoretical sense, but in regular use they work quite well. HereXs a regular expression: &quot;/Oh s.*t./&quot;. This will match strings like X&quot;Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light&quot;X and X&quot;Oh sit!&quot;X. See Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</dd>

<dt>
regular file</dt>
<dd>
A <b>file</b> thatXs not a <b>directory</b>, a  <b>device</b>, a named <b>pipe</b> or <b>socket</b>, or a <b>symbolic link</b>. Perl uses the &quot;Xf&quot; file test operator to identify regular files. Sometimes called a XplainX file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
relational operator</dt>

<dt>
reserved words</dt>
<dd>
A word with a specific, built-in meaning to a  <b>compiler</b>, such as &quot;if&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;. In many languages (not Perl), itXs illegal to use reserved words to name anything else. (Which is why theyXre reserved, after all.) In Perl, you just canXt use them to name  <b>labels</b> or <b>filehandles</b>. Also called XkeywordsX.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
runtime</dt>
<dd>
The time when Perl is actually doing what your code says to do, as opposed to the earlier period of time when it was trying to figure out whether what you said made any sense whatsoever, which is  <b>compile time</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
runtime pattern</dt>
<dd>
A pattern that contains one or more variables to be interpolated before parsing the pattern as a  <b>regular</b>  <b>expression</b>, and that therefore cannot be analyzed at compile time, but must be reanalyzed each time the pattern match operator is evaluated. Runtime patterns are useful but expensive.</dd>

<dd>
The situation in which an  <b>expression</b> is expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a single  <b>value</b> rather than a <b>list</b> of values. See also  <b>context</b> and <b>list context</b>. A scalar context sometimes imposes additional constraints on the return valueXsee  <b>string context</b> and  <b>numeric context</b>.

scope</dt>
<dd>
From how far away you can see a variable, looking through one. Perl has two visibility mechanisms. It does  <b>dynamic scoping</b> of &quot;local&quot;  <b>variables</b>, meaning that the rest of the <b>block</b>, and any  <b>subroutines</b> that are called by the rest of the block, can see the variables that are local to the block. Perl does  <b>lexical scoping</b> of &quot;my&quot; variables, meaning that the rest of the block can see the variable, but other subroutines called by the block  <i>cannot</i> see the variable.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
shell</dt>
<dd>
A <b>command</b>-line <b>interpreter</b>. The program that interactively gives you a prompt, accepts one or more  <b>lines</b> of input, and executes the programs you mentioned, feeding each of them their proper  <b>arguments</b> and input data. Shells can also execute scripts containing such commands. Under Unix, typical shells include the Bourne shell ( <i>/bin/sh</i>), the C shell (<i>/bin/csh</i>), and the Korn shell (<i>/bin/ksh</i>). Perl is not strictly a shell because itXs not interactive (although Perl programs can be interactive).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
side effects</dt>
<dd>
Something extra that happens when you evaluate an  <b>expression</b>. Nowadays it can refer to almost anything. For example, evaluating a simple assignment statement typically has the Xside effectX of assigning a value to a variable. (And you thought assigning the value was your primary intent in the first place!) Likewise, assigning a value to the special variable $| ($AUTOFLUSH) has the side effect of forcing a flush after every &quot;write&quot; or &quot;print&quot; on the currently selected filehandle.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
signal handler</dt>
<dd>
A <b>subroutine</b> that, instead of being content to be called in the normal fashion, sits around waiting for a bolt out of the blue before it will deign to  <b>execute</b>. Under Perl, bolts out of the blue are called signals, and you send them with the &quot;kill&quot; built-in. See the %SIG hash in Camel chapter 25, XSpecial NamesX and the section XSignalsX in Camel chapter 15, XInterprocess CommunicationX.</dd>

single inheritance</dt>
<dd>
The features you got from your mother, if she told you that you donXt have a father. (See also  <b>inheritance</b> and <b>multiple inheritance</b>.)

<dd>
The default output <b>stream</b> for nasty remarks that donXt belong in  <b>standard output</b>. Represented within a Perl program by the output&gt;  <b>filehandle</b> &quot;STDERR&quot;. You can use this stream explicitly, but the &quot;die&quot; and &quot;warn&quot; built-ins write to your standard error stream automatically (unless trapped or otherwise intercepted).</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
standard input</dt>

The default input <b>stream</b> for your program, which if possible shouldnXt care where its data is coming from. Represented within a Perl program by the  <b>filehandle</b> &quot;STDIN&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
standard I/O</dt>
<dd>
A standard C library for doing <b>buffered</b> input and output to the  <b>operating system</b>. (The XstandardX of standard I/O is at most marginally related to the XstandardX of standard input and output.) In general, Perl relies on whatever implementation of standard I/O a given operating system supplies, so the buffering characteristics of a Perl program on one machine may not exactly match those on another machine. Normally this only influences efficiency, not semantics. If your standard I/O package is doing block buffering and you want it to  <b>flush</b> the buffer more often, just set the $| variable to a true value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Standard Library</dt>
<dd>
Everything that comes with the official  <i>perl</i> distribution. Some vendor versions of <i>perl</i> change their distributions, leaving out some parts or including extras. See also  <b>dual-lived</b>.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
statement</dt>
<dd>
A <b>command</b> to the computer about what to do next, like a step in a recipe: XAdd marmalade to batter and mix until mixed.X A statement is distinguished from a  <b>declaration</b>, which doesnXt tell the computer to do anything, but just to learn something.</dd>

static</dt>
<dd>
Varying slowly compared to something else. (Unfortunately, everything is relatively stable compared to something else, except for certain elementary particles, and weXre not so sure about them.) In computers, where things are supposed to vary rapidly, XstaticX has a derogatory connotation, indicating a slightly dysfunctional  <b>variable</b>,  <b>subroutine</b>, or <b>method</b>. In Perl culture, the word is politely avoided.<div style="height: 1.00em;">

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
SV</dt>
<dd>
Short for Xscalar valueX. But within the Perl interpreter, every  <b>referent</b> is treated as a member of a class derived from SV, in an object-oriented sort of way. Every  <b>value</b> inside Perl is passed around as a C language &quot;SV*&quot; pointer. The SV  <b>struct</b> knows its own Xreferent typeX, and the code is smart enough (we hope) not to try to call a  <b>hash</b> function on a <b>subroutine</b>.</dd>

switch cluster</dt>
<dd>
The combination of multiple command- line switches ( <i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Xa Xb Xc&quot;) into one switch (<i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Xabc&quot;). Any switch with an additional  <b>argument</b> must be the last switch in a cluster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
switch statement</dt>
<dd>
A program technique that lets you evaluate an  <b>expression</b> and then, based on the value of the expression, do a multiway branch to the appropriate piece of code for that value. Also called a Xcase structureX, named after the similar Pascal construct. Most switch statements in Perl are spelled &quot;given&quot;.

<dt>
symbolic debugger</dt>
<dd>
A program that lets you step through the  <b>execution</b> of your program, stopping or printing things out here and there to see whether anything has gone wrong, and, if so, what. The XsymbolicX part just means that you can talk to the debugger using the same symbols with which your program is written.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
symbolic link</dt>
<dd>
An alternate filename that points to the real  <b>filename</b>, which in turn points to the real <b>file</b>. Whenever the  <b>operating system</b> is trying to parse a <b>pathname</b> containing a symbolic link, it merely substitutes the new name and continues parsing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
symbolic reference</dt>
<dd>
A variable whose value is the name of another variable or subroutine. By  <b>dereferencing</b> the first variable, you can get at the second one. Symbolic references are illegal under &quot;use strict &quot;refs&quot;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
symbol table</dt>
<dd>
Where a <b>compiler</b> remembers symbols. A program like Perl must somehow remember all the names of all the  <b>variables</b>,  <b>filehandles</b>, and <b>subroutines</b> youXve used. It does this by placing the names in a symbol table, which is implemented in Perl using a  <b>hash</b>  <b>table</b>. There is a separate symbol table for each <b>package</b> to give each package its own  <b>namespace</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

synchronous</dt>
<dd>
Programming in which the orderly sequence of events can be determined; that is, when things happen one after the other, not at the same time.</dd>

syntactic sugar</dt>
<dd>
An alternative way of writing something more easily; a shortcut.</dd>

<dd>
An internal representation of your program wherein lower-level  <b>constructs</b> dangle off the higher-level constructs enclosing them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
syscall</dt>
<dd>
A <b>function</b> call directly to the <b>operating</b>  <b>system</b>. Many of the important subroutines and functions you use arenXt direct system calls, but are built up in one or more layers above the system call level. In general, Perl programmers donXt need to worry about the distinction. However, if you do happen to know which Perl functions are really syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the $! ($ERRNO) variable on failure. Unfortunately, beginning programmers often confusingly employ the term Xsystem callX to mean what happens when you call the Perl &quot;system&quot; function, which actually involves many syscalls. To avoid any confusion, we nearly always say XsyscallX for something you could call indirectly via PerlXs &quot;syscall&quot; function, and never for something you would call with PerlXs &quot;system&quot; function.</dd>

<dt>
taint checks</dt>
<dd>
The special bookkeeping Perl does to track the flow of external data through your program and disallow their use in system commands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
tainted</dt>
<dd>
Said of data derived from the grubby hands of a user, and thus unsafe for a secure program to rely on. Perl does taint checks if you run a  <b>setuid</b> (or <b>setgid</b>) program, or if you use the &quot;XT&quot; switch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
taint mode</dt>
<dd>
Running under the &quot;XT&quot; switch, marking all external data as suspect and refusing to use it with system commands. See Camel chapter 20, XSecurityX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
TCP</dt>
<dd>
Short for Transmission Control Protocol. A protocol wrapped around the Internet Protocol to make an unreliable packet transmission mechanism appear to the application program to be a reliable  <b>stream</b> of bytes. (Usually.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
term</dt>
<dd>
Short for a XterminalXXthat is, a leaf node of a <b>syntax</b>  <b>tree</b>. A thing that functions grammatically as an <b>operand</b> for the operators in an expression.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
terminator</dt>
<dd>
A <b>character</b> or <b>string</b> that marks the end of another string. The $/ variable contains the string that terminates a &quot;readline&quot; operation, which &quot;chomp&quot; deletes from the end. Not to be confused with  <b>delimiters</b> or  <b>separators</b>. The period at the end of this sentence is a terminator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
ternary</dt>
<dd>
An <b>operator</b> taking three <b>operands</b>. Sometimes pronounced  <b>trinary</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
text</dt>
<dd>
A <b>string</b> or <b>file</b> containing primarily printable characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
thread</dt>
<dd>
Like a forked process, but without <b>fork</b>Xs inherent memory protection. A thread is lighter weight than a full process, in that a process could have multiple threads running around in it, all fighting over the same processXs memory space unless steps are taken to protect threads from one another.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
tie</dt>
<dd>
The bond between a magical variable and its implementation class. See the &quot;tie&quot; function in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX and Camel chapter 14, XTied VariablesX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
titlecase</dt>
<dd>
The case used for capitals that are followed by lowercase characters instead of by more capitals. Sometimes called sentence case or headline case. English doesnXt use Unicode titlecase, but casing rules for English titles are more complicated than simply capitalizing each wordXs first character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
TMTOWTDI</dt>
<dd>
ThereXs More Than One Way To Do It, the Perl Motto. The notion that there can be more than one valid path to solving a programming problem in context. (This doesnXt mean that more ways are always better or that all possible paths are equally desirableXjust that there need not be One True Way.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
token</dt>
<dd>
A morpheme in a programming language, the smallest unit of text with semantic significance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
tokener</dt>
<dd>
A module that breaks a program text into a sequence of  <b>tokens</b> for later analysis by a parser.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
tokenizing</dt>
<dd>
Splitting up a program text into <b>tokens</b>. Also known as XlexingX, in which case you get XlexemesX instead of tokens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
toolbox approach</dt>
<dd>
The notion that, with a complete set of simple tools that work well together, you can build almost anything you want. Which is fine if youXre assembling a tricycle, but if youXre building a defranishizing comboflux regurgalator, you really want your own machine shop in which to build special tools. Perl is sort of a machine shop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
topic</dt>
<dd>
The thing youXre working on. Structures like &quot;while(&lt;&gt;)&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;foreach&quot;, and &quot;given&quot; set the topic for you by assigning to $_, the default ( <i>topic</i>) variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
transliterate</dt>
<dd>
To turn one string representation into another by mapping each character of the source string to its corresponding character in the result string. Not to be confused with translation: for example, Greek  <i>XXXXXXXXXX</i> transliterates into  <i>polychromos</i> but translates into <i>many-colored</i>. See the &quot;tr///&quot; operator in Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
trigger</dt>
<dd>
An event that causes a <b>handler</b> to be run.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
trinary</dt>

Not a stellar system with three stars, but an  <b>operator</b> taking three <b>operands</b>. Sometimes pronounced <b>ternary</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
troff</dt>
<dd>
A venerable typesetting language from which Perl derives the name of its $% variable and which is secretly used in the production of Camel books.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
true</dt>
<dd>
Any scalar value that doesnXt evaluate to 0 or &quot;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
truncating</dt>
<dd>
Emptying a file of existing contents, either automatically when opening a file for writing or explicitly via the &quot;truncate&quot; function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
type</dt>
<dd>
See <b>data type</b> and <b>class</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
type casting</dt>
<dd>
Converting data from one type to another. C permits this. Perl does not need it. Nor want it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
typedef</dt>
<dd>
A type definition in the C and C++ languages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
typed lexical</dt>
<dd>
A <b>lexical variable</b>  lexical&gt;that is declared with a <b>class</b> type: &quot;my Pony $bill&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
typeglob</dt>
<dd>
Use of a single identifier, prefixed with &quot;*&quot;. For example, *name stands for any or all of $name, @name, %name, &amp;name, or just &quot;name&quot;. How you use it determines whether it is interpreted as all or only one of them. See XTypeglobs and FilehandlesX in Camel chapter 2, XBits and PiecesX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
typemap</dt>
<dd>
A description of how C types may be transformed to and from Perl types within an  <b>extension</b> module written in <b>XS</b>.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="subsection">
<h2>U</h2><dl>
<dt>
UDP</dt>
<dd>
User Datagram Protocol, the typical way to send  <b>datagrams</b> over the Internet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
UID</dt>

A user ID. Often used in the context of  <b>file</b> or <b>process</b> ownership.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
umask</dt>
<dd>
A mask of those <b>permission bits</b> that should be forced off when creating files or directories, in order to establish a policy of whom youXll ordinarily deny access to. See the &quot;umask&quot; function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
unary operator</dt>
<dd>
An operator with only one <b>operand</b>, like &quot;!&quot; or &quot;chdir&quot;. Unary operators are usually prefix operators; that is, they precede their operand. The &quot;++&quot; and &quot;XX&quot; operators can be either prefix or postfix. (Their position  <i>does</i> change their meanings.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unicode</dt>
<dd>
A character set comprising all the major character sets of the world, more or less. See &lt;http://www.unicode.org&gt;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
Unix</dt>
<dd>
A very large and constantly evolving language with several alternative and largely incompatible syntaxes, in which anyone can define anything any way they choose, and usually do. Speakers of this language think itXs easy to learn because itXs so easily twisted to oneXs own ends, but dialectical differences make tribal intercommunication nearly impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like subset of the language. To be universally understood, a Unix shell programmer must spend years of study in the art. Many have abandoned this discipline and now communicate via an Esperanto-like language called Perl.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
In ancient times, Unix was also used to refer to some code that a couple of people at Bell Labs wrote to make use of a PDP-7 computer that wasnXt doing much of anything else at the time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
uppercase</dt>
<dd>
In Unicode, not just characters with the General Category of Uppercase Letter, but any character with the Uppercase property, including some Letter Numbers and Symbols. Not to be confused with  <b>titlecase</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>V</h2><dl>

<dd>
An actual piece of data, in contrast to all the variables, references, keys, indices, operators, and whatnot that you need to access the value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
variable</dt>
<dd>
A named storage location that can hold any of various kinds of  <b>value</b>, as your program sees fit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
variable interpolation</dt>
<dd>
The <b>interpolation</b> of a scalar or array variable into a string.</dd>

Mathematical jargon for a list of <b>scalar values</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
virtual</dt>
<dd>
Providing the appearance of something without the reality, as in: virtual memory is not real memory. (See also  <b>memory</b>.) The opposite of XvirtualX is XtransparentX, which means providing the reality of something without the appearance, as in: Perl handles the variable-length UTFX8 character encoding transparently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
void context</dt>
<dd>
A form of <b>scalar context</b> in which an  <b>expression</b> is not expected to return any <b>value</b> at all and is evaluated for its  <b>side effects</b> alone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
v-string</dt>
<dd>
A XversionX or XvectorX <b>string</b> specified with a &quot;v&quot; followed by a series of decimal integers in dot notation, for instance, &quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;. Each number turns into a  <b>character</b> with the specified ordinal value. (The &quot;v&quot; is optional when there are at least three integers.)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>W</h2><dl>
<dt>
warning</dt>
<dd>
A message printed to the &quot;STDERR&quot; stream to the effect that something might be wrong but isnXt worth blowing up over. See &quot;warn&quot; in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX and the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma in Camel chapter 28, XPragmantic ModulesX.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
watch expression</dt>
<dd>
An expression which, when its value changes, causes a breakpoint in the Perl debugger.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
weak reference</dt>
<dd>
A reference that doesnXt get counted normally. When all the normal references to data disappear, the data disappears. These are useful for circular references that would never disappear otherwise.</dd>

<dt>
whitespace</dt>
<dd>
A <b>character</b> that moves your cursor but doesnXt otherwise put anything on your screen. Typically refers to any of: space, tab, line feed, carriage return, or form feed. In Unicode, matches many other characters that Unicode considers whitespace, including the X-XX .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
word</dt>
<dd>
In normal XcomputereseX, the piece of data of the size most efficiently handled by your computer, typically 32 bits or so, give or take a few powers of 2. In Perl culture, it more often refers to an alphanumeric  <b>identifier</b> (including underscores), or to a string of nonwhitespace  <b>characters</b> bounded by whitespace or string boundaries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
working directory</dt>
<dd>
Your current <b>directory</b>, from which relative pathnames are interpreted by the  <b>operating system</b>. The operating system knows your current directory because you told it with a &quot;chdir&quot;, or because you started out in the place where your parent  <b>process</b> was when you were born.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
wrapper</dt>
<dd>
A program or subroutine that runs some other program or subroutine for you, modifying some of its input or output to better suit your purposes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
WYSIWYG</dt>
<dd>
What You See Is What You Get. Usually used when something that appears on the screen matches how it will eventually look, like PerlXs &quot;format&quot; declarations. Also used to mean the opposite of magic because everything works exactly as it appears, as in the three- argument form of &quot;open&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>X</h2><dl>
<dt>
XS</dt>
