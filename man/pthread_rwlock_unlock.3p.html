<h1>NAME</h1> pthread_rwlock_unlock &#8212; unlock a read-write lock object</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int pthread_rwlock_unlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<i>rwlock</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() function shall release a lock held on the read-write lock object referenced by <i>rwlock</i>. Results are undefined if the read-write lock <i>rwlock</i> is not held by the calling thread.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If this function is called to release a read lock from the read-write lock object and there are other read locks currently held on this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object remains in the read locked state. If this function releases the last read lock for this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object shall be put in the unlocked state with no owners.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If this function is called to release a write lock for this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object shall be put in the unlocked state.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If there are threads blocked on the lock when it becomes available, the scheduling policy shall determine which thread(s) shall acquire the lock. If the Thread Execution Scheduling option is supported, when threads executing with the scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or SCHED_SPORADIC are waiting on the lock, they shall acquire the lock in priority order when the lock becomes available. For equal priority threads, write locks shall take precedence over read locks. If the Thread Execution Scheduling option is not supported, it is implementation-defined whether write locks take precedence over read locks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized read-write lock.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If successful, the  <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.<div class="spacer">

<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>rwlock</i> argument to  <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() does not refer to an initialized read-write lock object, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>rwlock</i> argument to  <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() refers to a read-write lock object for which the current thread does not hold a lock, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EPERM]</b> error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h1> None.</div>
