<h1>NAME</h1> exit &#8212; terminate a process</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
void exit(int <i>status</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&#160;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO&#160;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 defers to the ISO&#160;C standard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The value of <i>status</i> may be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, or any other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is, <i>status</i> &amp; 0377) shall be available to a waiting parent process.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>exit</i>() function shall first call all functions registered by  <i>atexit</i>(), in the reverse order of their registration, except that a function is called after any previously registered functions that had already been called at the time it was registered. Each function is called as many times as it was registered. If, during the call to any such function, a call to the  <i>longjmp</i>() function is made that would terminate the call to the registered function, the behavior is undefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a function registered by a call to  <i>atexit</i>() fails to return, the remaining registered functions shall not be called and the rest of the  <i>exit</i>() processing shall not be completed. If  <i>exit</i>() is called more than once, the behavior is undefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>exit</i>() function shall then flush all open streams with unwritten buffered data and close all open streams. Finally, the process shall be terminated with the same consequences as described in <i>Consequences of Process Termination</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> The  <i>exit</i>() function does not return.</div>
