<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This utility sends a SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command to the  <i>DEVICE</i>. It can issue self-tests, find supported diagnostic pages or send arbitrary diagnostic pages.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the <i>--list</i> option and a <i>DEVICE</i> are given then the utility sends a SCSI RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command to fetch the response (i.e. the page numbers of supported diagnostic pages).<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the <i>--list</i> option is given without a <i>DEVICE</i> then a list of diagnostic page names and their numbers, known by this utility, are listed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This utility supports two command line syntax-es, the preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and explained in this section. A later section on the old command line syntax outlines the second group of options.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.<dl>
<dt>
<b>-d</b>, <b>--doff</b></dt>
<dd>
set the Device Offline (DevOffL) bit (default is clear). Only significant when  <i>--test</i> option is set for the default self-test. When set other operations on any logical units controlled by the this device server (target) may be affected (delayed) while a default self-test is underway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-e</b>, <b>--extdur</b></dt>
<dd>
outputs the expected extended self-test duration. The duration is given in seconds (and minutes in parentheses). This figure is obtained from mode page 0xa (i.e. the control mode page).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></dt>
<dd>
print usage message then exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b></dt>
<dd>
outputs response from RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS in hex rather than decode it. Only the Supported Diagnostic Pages diagnostic page (i.e. page_code=0) is decoded; other pages (e.g. those used by SES) are output in hex.<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>--hex</i> is used once, the hex output has a relative address at the start of each line. If  <i>--hex</i> is used twice, then ASCII is shown to the right of each line of hex. If  <i>--hex</i> is used three time or more, only the hex is output, in two character pairs (i.e. a byte) space separated and up to 16 bytes per line. This latter form, if placed in a file or piped through to another invocation, is suitable for the  <i>--raw=-</i> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b></dt>
<dd>
when a <i>DEVICE</i> is also given lists the names of all diagnostic pages supported by this device. The request is sent via a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command (with the &quot;pF&quot; bit set) and the response is fetched by a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. When used in the absence of a  <i>--list</i> argument then a list of diagnostic page names and their numbers, known by this utility, are listed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-m</b>, <b>--maxlen</b>=<i>LEN</i></dt>
<dd>
where <i>LEN</i> is the value placed in the parameter list length field of a SEND DIAGNOSTIC command or in the allocation length field of a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. This only occurs when the other options imply there will be data sent or received by the command. The default value is 4096 bytes.  <i>LEN</i> cannot exceed 65535 or 0xffff in hexadecimal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-O</b>, <b>--old</b></dt>
<dd>
switch to older style options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-P</b>, <b>--page</b>=<i>PG</i></dt>
<dd>
where <i>PG</i> is the RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command page code field. If this option is given the PCV bit in that command is set. When this option is given then no SEND DIAGNOSTIC command is sent (unlike  <i>--list</i>). If  <i>PG</i> is 0 then the response is decoded as if it is the SPC Supported Diagnostic pages diagnostic page. Other  <i>PG</i> values (i.e. 1 to 255) have their responses output in hex.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-p</b>, <b>--pf</b></dt>
<dd>
set Page Format (PF) bit. By default it is clear (i.e. 0) unless the list  <i>--list</i> option is given in which case the Page Format bit is set (as required by SPC-3).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>=<i>H,H...</i></dt>
<dd>
string of comma separated hex numbers each of which should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). A (single) space separated string of hex bytes is also allowed but the list needs to be in quotes. This sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the  <i>--pf</i> option should also be given.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-r</b>, <b>--raw=-</b></dt>
<dd>
reads sequence of bytes from stdin. The sequence may be comma, space, tab or linefeed (newline) separated. If a line contains &quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters on that line are ignored. Otherwise each non separator character should resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). This sequence forms a diagnostic page to be sent with the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. Mostly likely the  <i>--pf</i> option should also be given.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-s</b>, <b>--selftest</b>=<i>ST</i></dt>
<dd>
where <i>ST</i> is the self-test code. The default value is 0 which is inactive. Some other values:<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  <b>1</b> : background short self-test<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  <b>2</b> : background extended self-test<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  <b>4</b> : aborts a (background) self-test that is in progress<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  <b>5</b> : foreground short self-test<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<br/>
  <b>6</b> : foreground extended self-test<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
This option is mutually exclusive with default self-test (i.e. can't have ( <i>ST</i> &gt; 0) and <i>--test</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b></dt>
<dd>
sets the _default_ Self Test (SelfTest) bit. By default this is clear (0). The  <i>--selftest=ST</i> option should not be active together with this option. Both the  <i>--doff</i> and/or <i>--uoff</i> options can be used with this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-u</b>, <b>--uoff</b></dt>
<dd>
set the Unit Offline (UnitOffL) bit (default is clear). Only significant when  <i>--test</i> option is set for the default self-test. When set other operations on this logical unit may be affected (delayed) while a default self-test is underway. Some devices (e.g. Fujitsu disks) do more tests when this bit is set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></dt>
<dd>
increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></dt>
<dd>
print out version string then exit.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> All devices should support the default self-test. The 'short' self-test codes should complete in 2 minutes or less. The 'extended' self-test codes' maximum duration is vendor specific (e.g. a little over 10 minutes with the author's disks). The foreground self-test codes wait until they are completed while the background self-test codes return immediately. The results of both foreground and background self-test codes are placed in the 'self-test results' log page (see sg_logs(8)). The SCSI command timeout for this utility is set to 60 minutes to allow for slow foreground extended self-tests.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <i>DEVICE</i> is a disk then no file systems residing on that disk should be mounted during a foreground self-test. The reason is that other SCSI commands may become queued behind the foreground self-test and timeout.<div class="spacer">
</div>
When the <i>--raw=H,H...</i> option is given then self-tests should not be selected. However the  <b>--pf</b> (i.e. &quot;page format&quot;) option should be given. The length of the diagnostic page to be sent is derived from the number of bytes given to the  <i>--raw=H,H...</i> option. The diagnostic page code (number) should be the first byte of the sequence (i.e. as dictated by SPC-3 diagnostic page format). See the EXAMPLES section below.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Arbitrary diagnostic pages can be read (in hex) with the sg_ses(8) utility (not only those defined in SES-2).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the utility is used with no options (e.g. &quot;sg_senddiag /dev/sg1&quot;) Then a degenerate SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC command is sent with zero in all its fields apart from the opcode. Some devices report this as an error while others ignore it. It is not entirely clear from SPC-3 if it is invalid to send such a command.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the <i>DEVICE</i> must be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices (e.g. SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To access SCSI enclosures see the sg_ses(8) utility. sg_ses uses the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS commands as outlined in the SES-2 (draft) standard.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXIT STATUS</h1> The exit status of sg_senddiag is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</h1> The options in this section were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23 . In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options can be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using '--old' (or '-O) as the first option.<dl>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> The examples sub-directory in the sg3_utils packages contains two example scripts that turn on the CJTPAT (jitter pattern) on some SAS disks (one script for each phy). One possible invocation for phy 1 is:<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
  sg_senddiag --pf --raw=- /dev/sg2 &lt; sdiag_sas_p1_cjtpat.txt<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is also an example script that turns on the IDLE pattern. Once a test pattern has been started it can be turned off by resetting the phy or with the STOP phy pattern function:<div class="spacer">
