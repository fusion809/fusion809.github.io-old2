<h1>NAME</h1> shm_open &#8212; open a shared memory object ( <b>REALTIME</b>)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int shm_open(const char *<i>name</i>, int <i>oflag</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>shm_open</i>() function shall establish a connection between a shared memory object and a file descriptor. It shall create an open file description that refers to the shared memory object and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file descriptor is used by other functions to refer to that shared memory object. The <i>name</i> argument points to a string naming a shared memory object. It is unspecified whether the name appears in the file system and is visible to other functions that take pathnames as arguments. The <i>name</i> argument conforms to the construction rules for a pathname, except that the interpretation of &lt;slash&gt; characters other than the leading &lt;slash&gt; character in <i>name</i> is implementation-defined, and that the length limits for the <i>name</i> argument are implementation-defined and need not be the same as the pathname limits {PATH_MAX} and {NAME_MAX}. If <i>name</i> begins with the &lt;slash&gt; character, then processes calling  <i>shm_open</i>() with the same value of <i>name</i> refer to the same shared memory object, as long as that name has not been removed. If <i>name</i> does not begin with the &lt;slash&gt; character, the effect is implementation-defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If successful,  <i>shm_open</i>() shall return a file descriptor for the shared memory object that is the lowest numbered file descriptor not currently open for that process. The open file description is new, and therefore the file descriptor does not share it with any other processes. It is unspecified whether the file offset is set. The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor is set.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The file status flags and file access modes of the open file description are according to the value of <i>oflag</i>. The <i>oflag</i> argument is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags defined in the <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> header. Applications specify exactly one of the first two values (access modes) below in the value of <i>oflag</i>:<dl>
<dt>
O_RDONLY</dt>
<dd>
Open for read access only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_RDWR</dt>
<dd>
Open for read or write access.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any combination of the remaining flags may be specified in the value of <i>oflag</i>:<dl>
<dt>
O_CREAT</dt>
<dd>
If the shared memory object exists, this flag has no effect, except as noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise, the shared memory object is created. The user ID of the shared memory object shall be set to the effective user ID of the process. The group ID of the shared memory object shall be set to the effective group ID of the process; however, if the <i>name</i> argument is visible in the file system, the group ID may be set to the group ID of the containing directory. The permission bits of the shared memory object shall be set to the value of the <i>mode</i> argument except those set in the file mode creation mask of the process. When bits in <i>mode</i> other than the file permission bits are set, the effect is unspecified. The <i>mode</i> argument does not affect whether the shared memory object is opened for reading, for writing, or for both. The shared memory object has a size of zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_EXCL</dt>
<dd>
If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set,  <i>shm_open</i>() fails if the shared memory object exists. The check for the existence of the shared memory object and the creation of the object if it does not exist is atomic with respect to other processes executing  <i>shm_open</i>() naming the same shared memory object with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not set, the result is undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_TRUNC</dt>
<dd>
If the shared memory object exists, and it is successfully opened O_RDWR, the object shall be truncated to zero length and the mode and owner shall be unchanged by this function call. The result of using O_TRUNC with O_RDONLY is undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When a shared memory object is created, the state of the shared memory object, including all data associated with the shared memory object, persists until the shared memory object is unlinked and all other references are gone. It is unspecified whether the name and shared memory object state remain valid after a system reboot.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion, the  <i>shm_open</i>() function shall return a non-negative integer representing the lowest numbered unused file descriptor. Otherwise, it shall return &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">

<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> When the Memory Mapped Files option is supported, the normal  <i>open</i>() call is used to obtain a descriptor to a file to be mapped according to existing practice with  <i>mmap</i>(). When the Shared Memory Objects option is supported, the  <i>shm_open</i>() function shall obtain a descriptor to the shared memory object to be mapped.<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is ample precedent for having a file descriptor represent several types of objects. In the POSIX.1&#8208;1990 standard, a file descriptor can represent a file, a pipe, a FIFO, a tty, or a directory. Many implementations simply have an operations vector, which is indexed by the file descriptor type and does very different operations. Note that in some cases the file descriptor passed to generic operations on file descriptors is returned by  <i>open</i>() or  <i>creat</i>() and in some cases returned by alternate functions, such as  <i>pipe</i>(). The latter technique is used by  <i>shm_open</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that such shared memory objects can actually be implemented as mapped files. In both cases, the size can be set after the open using  <i>ftruncate</i>(). The  <i>shm_open</i>() function itself does not create a shared object of a specified size because this would duplicate an extant function that set the size of an object referenced by a file descriptor.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On implementations where memory objects are implemented using the existing file system, the  <i>shm_open</i>() function may be implemented using a macro that invokes  <i>open</i>(), and the  <i>shm_unlink</i>() function may be implemented using a macro that invokes  <i>unlink</i>().<div class="spacer">
</div>
For implementations without a permanent file system, the definition of the name of the memory objects is allowed not to survive a system reboot. Note that this allows systems with a permanent file system to implement memory objects as data structures internal to the implementation as well.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On implementations that choose to implement memory objects using memory directly, a  <i>shm_open</i>() followed by an  <i>ftruncate</i>() and  <i>close</i>() can be used to preallocate a shared memory area and to set the size of that preallocation. This may be necessary for systems without virtual memory hardware support in order to ensure that the memory is contiguous.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The set of valid open flags to  <i>shm_open</i>() was restricted to O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, and O_TRUNC because these could be easily implemented on most memory mapping systems. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 is silent on the results if the implementation cannot supply the requested file access because of implementation-defined reasons, including hardware ones.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The error conditions <b>[EACCES]</b> and <b>[ENOTSUP]</b> are provided to inform the application that the implementation cannot complete a request.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>[EACCES]</b> indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a requested mode because it conflicts with another requested mode. An example might be that an application desires to open a memory object two times, mapping different areas with different access modes. If the implementation cannot map a single area into a process space in two places, which would be required if different access modes were required for the two areas, then the implementation may inform the application at the time of the second open.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>[ENOTSUP]</b> indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a requested mode at all. An example would be that the hardware of the implementation cannot support write-only shared memory areas.<div class="spacer">
</div>
On all implementations, it may be desirable to restrict the location of the memory objects to specific file systems for performance (such as a RAM disk) or implementation-defined reasons (shared memory supported directly only on certain file systems). The  <i>shm_open</i>() function may be used to enforce these restrictions. There are a number of methods available to the application to determine an appropriate name of the file or the location of an appropriate directory. One way is from the environment via  <i>getenv</i>(). Another would be from a configuration file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 specifies that memory objects have initial contents of zero when created. This is consistent with current behavior for both files and newly allocated memory. For those implementations that use physical memory, it would be possible that such implementations could simply use available memory and give it to the process uninitialized. This, however, is not consistent with standard behavior for the uninitialized data area, the stack, and of course, files. Finally, it is highly desirable to set the allocated memory to zero for security reasons. Thus, initializing memory objects to zero is required.</div>
