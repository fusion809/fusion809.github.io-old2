<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <b>clock</b> command performs several operations that obtain and manipulate values that represent times.  The command supports several subcommands that determine what action is carried out by the command.<dl>
<dt>
<b>clock add</b> <i>timeVal</i> ?<i>count unit...</i>? ?<i>-option value</i>?</dt>
<dd>
Adds a (possibly negative) offset to a time that is expressed as an integer number of seconds.  See  <b>CLOCK ARITHMETIC</b> for a full description.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>clock clicks</b> ?<i>-option</i>?</dt>
<dd>
If no <i>-option</i> argument is supplied, returns a high-resolution time value as a system-dependent integer value.  The unit of the value is system-dependent but should be the highest resolution clock available on the system such as a CPU cycle counter.  See  <b>HIGH RESOLUTION TIMERS</b> for a full description.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <i>-option</i> argument is <i>-milliseconds</i>, then the command is synonymous with  <b>clock milliseconds</b> (see below).  This usage is obsolete, and  <b>clock milliseconds</b> is to be considered the preferred way of obtaining a count of milliseconds.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <i>-option</i> argument is <i>-microseconds</i>, then the command is synonymous with  <b>clock microseconds</b> (see below).  This usage is obsolete, and  <b>clock microseconds</b> is to be considered the preferred way of obtaining a count of microseconds.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>clock format</b> <i>timeVal</i> ?<i>-option value</i>...?</dt>
<dd>
Formats a time that is expressed as an integer number of seconds into a format intended for consumption by users or external programs. See  <b>FORMATTING TIMES</b> for a full description.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>clock microseconds</b></dt>
<dd>
Returns the current time as an integer number of microseconds.  See <b>HIGH RESOLUTION TIMERS</b> for a full description.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>clock milliseconds</b></dt>
<dd>
Returns the current time as an integer number of milliseconds.  See <b>HIGH RESOLUTION TIMERS</b> for a full description.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>clock scan</b> <i>inputString</i> ?<i>-option value</i>...?</dt>
<dd>
Scans a time that is expressed as a character string and produces an integer number of seconds. See  <b>SCANNING TIMES</b> for a full description.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>clock seconds</b></dt>
<dd>
Returns the current time as an integer number of seconds.</dd>

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2><dl>
<dt>
<i>count</i></dt>
<dd>
An integer representing a count of some unit of time.  See  <b>CLOCK ARITHMETIC</b> for the details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>timeVal</i></dt>
<dd>
An integer value passed to the <b>clock</b> command that represents an absolute time as a number of seconds from the  <i>epoch time</i> of 1 January 1970, 00:00 UTC.  Note that the count of seconds does not include any leap seconds; seconds are counted as if each UTC day has exactly 86400 seconds.  Tcl responds to leap seconds by speeding or slowing its clock by a tiny fraction for some minutes until it is back in sync with UTC; its data model does not represent minutes that have 59 or 61 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>unit</i></dt>
<dd>
One of the words, <b>seconds</b>, <b>minutes</b>, <b>hours</b>,  <b>days</b>, <b>weeks</b>, <b>months</b>, or <b>years</b>, or any unique prefix of such a word. Used in conjunction with  <i>count</i> to identify an interval of time, for example,  <i>3 seconds</i> or  <i>1 year</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>OPTIONS</h2><dl>
<dt>
<b>-base</b> time</dt>
<dd>
Specifies that any relative times present in a <b>clock scan</b> command are to be given relative to  <i>time</i>.  <i>time</i> must be expressed as a count of nominal seconds from the epoch time of 1 January 1970, 00:00 UTC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-format</b> format</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the desired output format for <b>clock format</b> or the expected input format for  <b>clock scan</b>.  The <i>format</i> string consists of any number of characters other than the per-cent sign (&#8220; <b>%</b>&#8221;) interspersed with any number of  <i>format groups</i>, which are two-character sequences beginning with the per-cent sign.  The permissible format groups, and their interpretation, are described under  <b>FORMAT GROUPS</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
On <b>clock format</b>, the default format is<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %z %Y<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
On <b>clock scan</b>, the lack of a <i>-format</i> option indicates that a &#8220;free format scan&#8221; is requested; see  <b>FREE FORM SCAN</b> for a description of what happens.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-gmt</b> boolean</dt>
<dd>
If <i>boolean</i> is true, specifies that a time specified to <b>clock add</b>,  <b>clock format</b> or <b>clock scan</b> should be processed in UTC.  If  <i>boolean</i> is false, the processing defaults to the local time zone.  This usage is obsolete; the correct current usage is to specify the UTC time zone with &#8220; <b>-timezone</b> <i>:UTC</i>&#8221; or any of the equivalent ways to specify it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-locale</b> localeName</dt>
<dd>
Specifies that locale-dependent scanning and formatting (and date arithmetic for dates preceding the adoption of the Gregorian calendar) is to be done in the locale identified by  <i>localeName</i>.  The locale name may be any of the locales acceptable to the  <b>msgcat</b> package, or it may be the special name  <i>system</i>, which represents the current locale of the process, or the null string, which represents Tcl's default locale.</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The effect of locale on scanning and formatting is discussed in the descriptions of the individual format groups under  <b>FORMAT GROUPS</b>. The effect of locale on clock arithmetic is discussed under  <b>CLOCK ARITHMETIC</b>.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-timezone</b> zoneName</dt>
<dd>
Specifies that clock arithmetic, formatting, and scanning are to be done according to the rules for the time zone specified by  <i>zoneName</i>. The permissible values, and their interpretation, are discussed under  <b>TIME ZONES</b>. On subcommands that expect a  <b>-timezone</b> argument, the default is to use the  <i>current time zone</i>.  The current time zone is determined, in order of preference, by:</dd>

</div>
If none of these is present, the C <b>localtime</b> and <b>mktime</b> functions are used to attempt to convert times between local and Greenwich.  On 32-bit systems, this approach is likely to have bugs, particularly for times that lie outside the window (approximately the years 1902 to 2037) that can be represented in a 32-bit integer.</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CLOCK ARITHMETIC</h1> The  <b>clock add</b> command performs clock arithmetic on a value (expressed as nominal seconds from the epoch time of 1 January 1970, 00:00 UTC) given as its first argument.  The remaining arguments (other than the possible  <b>-timezone</b>, <b>-locale</b> and <b>-gmt</b> options) are integers and keywords in alternation, where the keywords are chosen from  <b>seconds</b>, <b>minutes</b>, <b>hours</b>,  <b>days</b>, <b>weeks</b>, <b>months</b>, or <b>years</b>, or any unique prefix of such a word.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Addition of seconds, minutes and hours is fairly straightforward; the given time increment (times sixty for minutes, or 3600 for hours) is simply added to the  <i>timeVal</i> given to the  <b>clock add</b> command.  The result is interpreted as a nominal number of seconds from the Epoch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Surprising results may be obtained when crossing a point at which a leap second is inserted or removed; the  <b>clock add</b> command simply ignores leap seconds and therefore assumes that times come in sequence, 23:59:58, 23:59:59, 00:00:00.  (This assumption is handled by the fact that Tcl's model of time reacts to leap seconds by speeding or slowing the clock by a minuscule amount until Tcl's time is back in step with the world.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The fact that adding and subtracting hours is defined in terms of absolute time means that it will add fixed amounts of time in time zones that observe summer time (Daylight Saving Time).  For example, the following code sets the value of  <b>x</b> to <b>04:00:00</b> because the clock has changed in the interval in question.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
set s [<b>clock scan</b> {2004-10-30 05:00:00} \<br/>
           -format {%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S} \<br/>
           -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
set a [<b>clock add</b> $s 24 hours -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
set x [<b>clock format</b> $a \<br/>
           -format {%H:%M:%S} -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Adding and subtracting days and weeks is accomplished by converting the given time to a calendar day and time of day in the appropriate time zone and locale.  The requisite number of days (weeks are converted to days by multiplying by seven) is added to the calendar day, and the date and time are then converted back to a count of seconds from the epoch time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Adding and subtracting a given number of days across the point that the time changes at the start or end of summer time (Daylight Saving Time) results in the  <i>same local time</i> on the day in question.  For instance, the following code sets the value of  <b>x</b> to <b>05:00:00</b>.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
set s [<b>clock scan</b> {2004-10-30 05:00:00} \<br/>
           -format {%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S} \<br/>
           -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
set a [<b>clock add</b> $s 1 day -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
set x [<b>clock format</b> $a \<br/>
           -format {%H:%M:%S} -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In cases of ambiguity, where the same local time happens twice on the same day, the earlier time is used.  In cases where the conversion yields an impossible time (for instance, 02:30 during the Spring Daylight Saving Time change using US rules), the time is converted as if the clock had not changed.  Thus, the following code will set the value of  <b>x</b> to <b>03:30:00</b>.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
set s [<b>clock scan</b> {2004-04-03 02:30:00} \<br/>
           -format {%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S} \<br/>
           -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
set a [<b>clock add</b> $s 1 day -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
set x [<b>clock format</b> $a \<br/>
           -format {%H:%M:%S} -timezone :America/New_York]<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Adding a given number of days or weeks works correctly across the conversion between the Julian and Gregorian calendars; the omitted days are skipped. The following code sets  <b>z</b> to <b>1752-09-14</b>.<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
set x [<b>clock scan</b> 1752-09-02 -format %Y-%m-%d -locale en_US]<br/>
set y [<b>clock add</b> $x 1 day -locale en_US]<br/>
set z [<b>clock format</b> $y -format %Y-%m-%d -locale en_US]<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the bizarre case that adding the given number of days yields a date that does not exist because it falls within the dropped days of the Julian-to-Gregorian conversion, the date is converted as if it was on the Julian calendar.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Adding a number of months, or a number of years, is similar; it converts the given time to a calendar date and time of day.  It then adds the requisite number of months or years, and reconverts the resulting date and time of day to an absolute time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the resulting date is impossible because the month has too few days (for example, when adding 1 month to 31 January), the last day of the month is substituted.  Thus, adding 1 month to 31 January will result in 28 February in a common year or 29 February in a leap year.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The rules for handling anomalies relating to summer time and to the Gregorian calendar are the same when adding/subtracting months and years as they are when adding/subtracting days and weeks.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If multiple <i>count unit</i> pairs are present on the command, they are evaluated consecutively, from left to right.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>HIGH RESOLUTION TIMERS</h1> Most of the subcommands supported by the  <b>clock</b> command deal with times represented as a count of seconds from the epoch time, and this is the representation that  <b>clock seconds</b> returns.  There are three exceptions, which are all intended for use where higher-resolution times are required.  <b>clock milliseconds</b> returns the count of milliseconds from the epoch time, and  <b>clock microseconds</b> returns the count of microseconds from the epoch time. In addition, there is a  <b>clock clicks</b> command that returns a platform-dependent high-resolution timer.  Unlike  <b>clock seconds</b> and <b>clock milliseconds</b>, the value of  <b>clock clicks</b> is not guaranteed to be tied to any fixed epoch; it is simply intended to be the most precise interval timer available, and is intended only for relative timing studies such as benchmarks.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FORMATTING TIMES</h1> The  <b>clock format</b> command produces times for display to a user or writing to an external medium.  The command accepts times that are expressed in seconds from the epoch time of 1 January 1970, 00:00 UTC, as returned by  <b>clock seconds</b>, <b>clock scan</b>, <b>clock add</b>,  <b>file atime</b> or <b>file mtime</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <b>-format</b> option is present, the following argument is a string that specifies how the date and time are to be formatted. The string consists of any number of characters other than the per-cent sign (&#8220; <b>%</b>&#8221;) interspersed with any number of  <i>format groups</i>, which are two-character sequences beginning with the per-cent sign.  The permissible format groups, and their interpretation, are described under  <b>FORMAT GROUPS</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <b>-timezone</b> option is present, the following argument is a string that specifies the time zone in which the date and time are to be formatted.  As an alternative to &#8220; <b>-timezone</b> <i>:UTC</i>&#8221;, the obsolete usage &#8220; <b>-gmt</b> <i>true</i>&#8221; may be used.  See  <b>TIME ZONES</b> for the permissible variants for the time zone.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <b>-locale</b> option is present, the following argument is a string that specifies the locale in which the time is to be formatted, in the same format that is used for the  <b>msgcat</b> package.  Note that the default, if  <b>-locale</b> is not specified, is the root locale  <b>{}</b> rather than the current locale.  The current locale may be obtained by using  <b>-locale</b> <b>current</b>. In addition, some platforms support a  <b>system</b> locale that reflects the user's current choices.  For instance, on Windows, the format that the user has selected from dates and times in the Control Panel can be obtained by using the  <b>system</b> locale.  On platforms that do not define a user selection of date and time formats separate from  <b>LC_TIME</b>, <b>-locale</b> <b>system</b> is synonymous with  <b>-locale</b> <b>current</b>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SCANNING TIMES</h1> The  <b>clock scan</b> command accepts times that are formatted as strings and converts them to counts of seconds from the epoch time of 1 January 1970, 00:00 UTC.  It normally takes a  <b>-format</b> option that is followed by a string describing the expected format of the input.  (See  <b>FREE FORM SCAN</b> for the effect of <b>clock scan</b> without such an argument.)  The string consists of any number of characters other than the per-cent sign (&#8220; <b>%</b>&#8221;), interspersed with any number of  <i>format groups</i>, which are two-character sequences beginning with the per-cent sign.  The permissible format groups, and their interpretation, are described under  <b>FORMAT GROUPS</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <b>-timezone</b> option is present, the following argument is a string that specifies the time zone in which the date and time are to be interpreted.  As an alternative to  <b>-timezone</b> <i>:UTC</i>, the obsolete usage  <b>-gmt</b> <i>true</i> may be used.  See  <b>TIME ZONES</b> for the permissible variants for the time zone.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <b>-locale</b> option is present, the following argument is a string that specifies the locale in which the time is to be interpreted, in the same format that is used for the  <b>msgcat</b> package.  Note that the default, if  <b>-locale</b> is not specified, is the root locale  <b>{}</b> rather than the current locale.  The current locale may be obtained by using  <b>-locale</b> <b>current</b>. In addition, some platforms support a  <b>system</b> locale that reflects the user's current choices.  For instance, on Windows, the format that the user has selected from dates and times in the Control Panel can be obtained by using the  <b>system</b> locale.  On platforms that do not define a user selection of date and time formats separate from  <b>LC_TIME</b>, <b>-locale</b> <b>system</b> is synonymous with  <b>-locale</b> <b>current</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a <b>-base</b> option is present, the following argument is a time (expressed in seconds from the epoch time) that is used as a  <i>base time</i> for interpreting relative times.  If no  <b>-base</b> option is present, the base time is the current time.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Scanning of times in fixed format works by determining three things: the date, the time of day, and the time zone.  These three are then combined into a point in time, which is returned as the number of seconds from the epoch.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Before scanning begins, the format string is preprocessed to replace  <b>%c</b>, <b>%Ec</b>, <b>%x</b>, <b>%Ex</b>,  <b>%X</b>. <b>%Ex</b>, <b>%r</b>, <b>%R</b>, <b>%T</b>,  <b>%D</b>, <b>%EY</b> and <b>%+</b> format groups with counterparts that are appropriate to the current locale and contain none of the above groups.  For instance,  <b>%D</b> will (in the <b>en_US</b> locale) be replaced with  <b>%m/%d/%Y</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The date is determined according to the fields that are present in the preprocessed format string.  In order of preference:<dl>
<dt>
[1]</dt>
<dd>
If the string contains a <b>%s</b> format group, representing seconds from the epoch, that group is used to determine the date.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[2]</dt>
<dd>
If the string contains a <b>%J</b> format group, representing the Julian Day Number, that group is used to determine the date.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[3]</dt>
<dd>
If the string contains a complete set of format groups specifying century, year, month, and day of month; century, year, and day of year; or ISO8601 fiscal year, week of year, and day of week; those groups are combined and used to determine the date.  If more than one complete set is present, the one at the rightmost position in the string is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[4]</dt>
<dd>
If the string lacks a century but contains a set of format groups specifying year of century, month and day of month; year of century and day of year; or two-digit ISO8601 fiscal year, week of year, and day of week; those groups are combined and used to determine the date.  If more than one complete set is present, the one at the rightmost position in the string is used.  The year is presumed to lie in the range 1938 to 2037 inclusive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[5]</dt>
<dd>
If the string entirely lacks any specification for the year (or contains the year only on the locale's alternative calendar) and contains a set of format groups specifying month and day of month, day of year, or week of year and day of week, those groups are combined and used to determine the date.  If more than one complete set is present, the one at the rightmost position in the string is used.  The year is determined by interpreting the base time in the given time zone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[6]</dt>
<dd>
If the string contains none of the above sets, but has a day of the month or day of the week, the day of the month or day of the week are used to determine the date by interpreting the base time in the given time zone and returning the given day of the current week or month. (The week runs from Monday to Sunday, ISO8601-fashion.)  If both day of month and day of week are present, the day of the month takes priority.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[7]</dt>
<dd>
If none of the above rules results in a usable date, the date of the base time in the given time zone is used.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The time is also determined according to the fields that are present in the preprocessed format string.  In order of preference:<dl>
<dt>
[1]</dt>
<dd>
If the string contains a <b>%s</b> format group, representing seconds from the epoch, that group determines the time of day.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[2]</dt>
<dd>
If the string contains either an hour on the 24-hour clock or an hour on the 12-hour clock plus an AM/PM indicator, that hour determines the hour of the day.  If the string further contains a group specifying the minute of the hour, that group combines with the hour.  If the string further contains a group specifying the second of the minute, that group combines with the hour and minute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
[3]</dt>
<dd>
If the string contains neither a <b>%s</b> format group nor a group specifying the hour of the day, then midnight ( <b>00:00</b>, the start of the given date) is used. The time zone is determined by either the  <b>-timezone</b> or <b>-gmt</b> options, or by using the current time zone.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a format string lacks a <b>%z</b> or <b>%Z</b> format group, it is possible for the time to be ambiguous because it appears twice in the same day, once without and once with Daylight Saving Time. If this situation occurs, the first occurrence of the time is chosen. (For this reason, it is wise to have the input string contain the time zone when converting local times.  This caveat does not apply to UTC times.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FORMAT GROUPS</h1> The following format groups are recognized by the  <b>clock scan</b> and  <b>clock format</b> commands.<dl>
<dt>
<b>%a</b></dt>
<dd>
On output, receives an abbreviation (<i>e.g.,</i> <b>Mon</b>) for the day of the week in the given locale.  On input, matches the name of the day of the week in the given locale (in either abbreviated or full form, or any unique prefix of either form).</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>%V</b></dt>

Week 01 is the week containing January 4; or the first week of the year containing at least 4 days; or the week containing the first Thursday of the year (the three statements are equivalent). Each week begins on a Monday. On input, accepts the ISO8601 week number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>%w</b></dt>
<dd>
On output, produces the ordinal number of the day of the week (Sunday==0; Saturday==6).

<dd>
On output, produces the two-digit year of the century. On input, accepts two digits, and is used to determine calendar date. The date is presumed to lie between 1938 and 2037 inclusive. Note that  <b>%y</b> does not yield a year appropriate for use with the ISO8601 week number  <b>%V</b>; programs should use <b>%g</b> for that purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>%Y</b></dt>
<dd>
On output, produces the four-digit calendar year. On input, accepts four digits and may be used to determine calendar date. Note that  <b>%Y</b> does not yield a year appropriate for use with the ISO8601 week number  <b>%V</b>; programs should use <b>%G</b> for that purpose.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>%Z</b></dt>
<dd>
On output, produces the current time zone's name, possibly translated to the given locale. On input, accepts a time zone specifier (see  <b>TIME ZONES</b> below) that will be used to determine the time zone. This option should, in general, be used on input only when parsing RFC822 dates. Other uses are fraught with ambiguity; for instance, the string  <b>BST</b> may represent British Summer Time or Brazilian Standard Time. It is recommended that date/time strings for use by computers use numeric time zones instead.</dd>

If it is a string in the above list, it designates a known time zone, and is interpreted as such.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For time zones in case [1] that do not match any of the above strings, and always for cases [2]-[6], the following rules apply.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the time zone begins with a colon, it is one of a standardized list of names like  <b>:America/New_York</b> that give the rules for various locales.  A complete list of the location names is too lengthy to be listed here. On most Tcl installations, the definitions of the locations are to be found in named files in the directory &#8220; <i>/no_backup/tools/lib/tcl8.5/clock/tzdata</i>&#8221;. On some Unix systems, these files are omitted, and the definitions are instead obtained from system files in &#8220; <i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i>&#8221;, &#8220; <i>/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo</i>&#8221; or &#8220; <i>/usr/local/etc/zoneinfo</i>&#8221;. As a special case, the name  <b>:localtime</b> refers to the local time zone as defined by the C library.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A time zone string consisting of a plus or minus sign followed by four or six decimal digits is interpreted as an offset in hours, minutes, and seconds (if six digits are present) from UTC.  The plus sign denotes a sign east of Greenwich; the minus sign one west of Greenwich.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A time zone string conforming to the Posix specification of the <b>TZ</b> environment variable will be recognized.  The specification may be found at  <i>http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any other time zone string is processed by prefixing a colon and attempting to use it as a location name, as above.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>LOCALIZATION</h1> Developers wishing to localize the date and time formatting and parsing are referred to  <i>http://tip.tcl.tk/173</i> for a specification.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FREE FORM SCAN</h1> If the  <b>clock scan</b> command is invoked without a <b>-format</b> option, then it requests a  <i>free-form scan.</i>  <i></i>  <i>This form of scan is deprecated.</i>  The reason for the deprecation is that there are too many ambiguities. (Does the string &#8220;2000&#8221; represent a year, a time of day, or a quantity?)  No set of rules for interpreting free-form dates and times has been found to give unsurprising results in all cases.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If free-form scan is used, only the <b>-base</b> and <b>-gmt</b> options are accepted.  The  <b>-timezone</b> and <b>-locale</b> options will result in an error if  <b>-format</b> is not supplied.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For the benefit of users who need to understand legacy code that uses free-form scan, the documentation for how free-form scan interprets a string is included here:<div class="spacer">
</div>
If only a time is specified, the current date is assumed.  If the  <i>inputString</i> does not contain a time zone mnemonic, the local time zone is assumed, unless the  <b>-gmt</b> argument is true, in which case the clock value is calculated assuming that the specified time is relative to Greenwich Mean Time.  <b>-gmt</b>, if specified, affects only the computed time value; it does not impact the interpretation of  <b>-base</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <b>-base</b> flag is specified, the next argument should contain an integer clock value.  Only the date in this value is used, not the time.  This is useful for determining the time on a specific day or doing other date-relative conversions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>inputString</i> argument consists of zero or more specifications of the following form:<dl>
<dt>
<i>time</i></dt>
<dd>
A time of day, which is of the form: <b>hh?:mm?:ss?? ?meridian? ?zone?</b> or  <b>hhmm ?meridian? ?zone?</b> If no meridian is specified,  <b>hh</b> is interpreted on a 24-hour clock.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>date</i></dt>
<dd>
A specific month and day with optional year.  The acceptable formats are &#8220; <b>mm/dd</b>?<b>/yy</b>?&#8221;, &#8220; <b>monthname dd</b>?<b>, yy</b>?&#8221;, &#8220; <b>day, dd monthname </b>?<b>yy</b>?&#8221;, &#8220; <b>dd monthname yy</b>&#8221;, &#8220;? <b>CC</b>?<b>yymmdd</b>&#8221;, and &#8220; <b>dd-monthname-</b>?<b>CC</b>?<b>yy</b>&#8221;. The default year is the current year.  If the year is less than 100, we treat the years 00-68 as 2000-2068 and the years 69-99 as 1969-1999.  Not all platforms can represent the years 38-70, so an error may result if these years are used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>ISO 8601 point-in-time</i></dt>
<dd>
An ISO 8601 point-in-time specification, such as &#8220; <i>CCyymmdd</i><b>T</b><i>hhmmss</i>,&#8221; where  <b>T</b> is the literal &#8220;T&#8221;, &#8220; <i>CCyymmdd hhmmss</i>&#8221;, or &#8220; <i>CCyymmdd</i><b>T</b><i>hh:mm:ss</i>&#8221;. Note that only these three formats are accepted. The command does  <i>not</i> accept the full range of point-in-time specifications specified in ISO8601.  Other formats can be recognized by giving an explicit  <i>-format</i> option to the <b>clock scan</b> command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>relative time</i></dt>
<dd>
A specification relative to the current time.  The format is <b>number</b>  <b>unit</b>. Acceptable units are <b>year</b>, <b>fortnight</b>,  <b>month</b>, <b>week</b>, <b>day</b>,  <b>hour</b>, <b>minute</b> (or <b>min</b>), and <b>second</b> (or <b>sec</b>).  The unit can be specified as a singular or plural, as in  <b>3 weeks</b>. These modifiers may also be specified:  <b>tomorrow</b>, <b>yesterday</b>, <b>today</b>, <b>now</b>,  <b>last</b>, <b>this</b>, <b>next</b>, <b>ago</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The actual date is calculated according to the following steps.<div class="spacer">
</div>
First, any absolute date and/or time is processed and converted. Using that time as the base, day-of-week specifications are added. Next, relative specifications are used.  If a date or day is specified, and no absolute or relative time is given, midnight is used.  Finally, a correction is applied so that the correct hour of the day is produced after allowing for daylight savings time differences and the correct date is given when going from the end of a long month to a short month.</div>
