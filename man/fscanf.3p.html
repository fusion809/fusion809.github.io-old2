<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&#160;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO&#160;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 defers to the ISO&#160;C standard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>fscanf</i>() function shall read from the named input <i>stream</i>. The  <i>scanf</i>() function shall read from the standard input stream <i>stdin</i>. The  <i>sscanf</i>() function shall read from the string <i>s</i>. Each function reads bytes, interprets them according to a format, and stores the results in its arguments. Each expects, as arguments, a control string <i>format</i> described below, and a set of <i>pointer</i> arguments indicating where the converted input should be stored. The result is undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments shall be evaluated but otherwise ignored.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Conversions can be applied to the <i>n</i>th argument after the <i>format</i> in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument. In this case, the conversion specifier character <b>%</b> (see below) is replaced by the sequence &quot;% <i>n</i>$&quot;, where <i>n</i> is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}]. This feature provides for the definition of format strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific languages. In format strings containing the &quot;% <i>n</i>$&quot; form of conversion specifications, it is unspecified whether numbered arguments in the argument list can be referenced from the format string more than once.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>format</i> can contain either form of a conversion specification&#8212;that is, <b>%</b> or &quot;% <i>n</i>$&quot;&#8212;but the two forms cannot be mixed within a single <i>format</i> string. The only exception to this is that <b>%%</b> or <b>%*</b> can be mixed with the &quot;% <i>n</i>$&quot; form. When numbered argument specifications are used, specifying the <i>N</i>th argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to the (<i>N</i>&#8722;1)th, are pointers.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>fscanf</i>() function in all its forms shall allow detection of a language-dependent radix character in the input string. The radix character is defined in the current locale (category <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix character shall default to a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The format is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any, composed of zero or more directives. Each directive is composed of one of the following: one or more white-space characters (&lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;vertical-tab&gt;, or &lt;form-feed&gt;); an ordinary character (neither <b>'%'</b> nor a white-space character); or a conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character <b>'%'</b> or the character sequence &quot;% <i>n</i>$&quot;, after which the following appear in sequence:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
An optional assignment-suppressing character <b>'*'</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field width.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
An optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
An option length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A <i>conversion specifier</i> character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The valid conversion specifiers are described below.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>fscanf</i>() functions shall execute each directive of the format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below, the function shall return. Failures are described as input failures (due to the unavailability of input bytes) or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).<div class="spacer">
</div>
A directive composed of one or more white-space characters shall be executed by reading input until no more valid input can be read, or up to the first byte which is not a white-space character, which remains unread.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A directive that is an ordinary character shall be executed as follows: the next byte shall be read from the input and compared with the byte that comprises the directive; if the comparison shows that they are not equivalent, the directive shall fail, and the differing and subsequent bytes shall remain unread. Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a character from being read, the directive shall fail.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion character. A conversion specification shall be executed in the following steps.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Input white-space characters (as specified by <i><i>isspace</i>()</i>) shall be skipped, unless the conversion specification includes a <b>[</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>C</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion specifier.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An item shall be read from the input, unless the conversion specification includes an <b>n</b> conversion specifier. An input item shall be defined as the longest sequence of input bytes (up to any specified maximum field width, which may be measured in characters or bytes dependent on the conversion specifier) which is an initial subsequence of a matching sequence. The first byte, if any, after the input item shall remain unread. If the length of the input item is 0, the execution of the conversion specification shall fail; this condition is a matching failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Except in the case of a <b>%</b> conversion specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a <b>%n</b> conversion specification, the count of input bytes) shall be converted to a type appropriate to the conversion character. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the conversion specification fails; this condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a <b>'*'</b>, the result of the conversion shall be placed in the object pointed to by the first argument following the <i>format</i> argument that has not already received a conversion result if the conversion specification is introduced by <b>%</b>, or in the <i>n</i>th argument if introduced by the character sequence &quot;% <i>n</i>$&quot;. If this object does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented in the space provided, the behavior is undefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <b>%c</b>, <b>%s</b>, and <b>%[</b> conversion specifiers shall accept an optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>, which shall cause a memory buffer to be allocated to hold the string converted including a terminating null character. In such a case, the argument corresponding to the conversion specifier should be a reference to a pointer variable that will receive a pointer to the allocated buffer. The system shall allocate a buffer as if  <i>malloc</i>() had been called. The application shall be responsible for freeing the memory after usage. If there is insufficient memory to allocate a buffer, the function shall set <i>errno</i> to <b>[ENOMEM]</b> and a conversion error shall result. If the function returns EOF, any memory successfully allocated for parameters using assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b> by this call shall be freed before the function returns.<div style="height: 0.00em;">

<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> If the application calling  <i>fscanf</i>() has any objects of type <b>wint_t</b> or <b>wchar_t</b>, it must also include the <i>&lt;wchar.h&gt;</i> header to have these objects defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For functions that allocate memory as if by  <i>malloc</i>(), the application should release such memory when it is no longer required by a call to  <i>free</i>(). For  <i>fscanf</i>(), this is memory allocated via use of the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> This function is aligned with the ISO/IEC&#160;9899:1999 standard, and in doing so a few ``obvious'' things were not included. Specifically, the set of characters allowed in a scanset is limited to single-byte characters. In other similar places, multi-byte characters have been permitted, but for alignment with the ISO/IEC&#160;9899:1999 standard, it has not been done here. Applications needing this could use the corresponding wide-character functions to achieve the desired results.</div>
