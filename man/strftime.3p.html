<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> For  <i>strftime</i>(): The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&#160;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO&#160;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 defers to the ISO&#160;C standard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>strftime</i>() function shall place bytes into the array pointed to by <i>s</i> as controlled by the string pointed to by <i>format</i>. The format is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and ordinary characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Each conversion specification is introduced by the <b>'%'</b> character after which the following appear in sequence:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
An optional flag:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl>
<dt>
0</dt>
<dd>
The zero character (<b>'0'</b>), which specifies that the character used as the padding character is <b>'0'</b>,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
+</dt>
<dd>
The &lt;plus-sign&gt; character (<b>'+'</b>), which specifies that the character used as the padding character is <b>'0'</b>, and that if and only if the field being produced consumes more than four bytes to represent a year (for <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, or <b>%Y</b>) or more than two bytes to represent the year divided by 100 (for <b>%C</b>) then a leading &lt;plus-sign&gt; character shall be included if the year being processed is greater than or equal to zero or a leading minus-sign character (<b>'&#8722;'</b>) shall be included if the year is less than zero.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The default padding character is unspecified.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
An optional minimum field width. If the converted value, including any leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'&#8722;'</b> sign, has fewer bytes than the minimum field width and the padding character is not the NUL character, the output shall be padded on the left (after any leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'&#8722;'</b> sign) with the padding character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
An optional <b>E</b> or <b>O</b> modifier.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A terminating conversion specifier character that indicates the type of conversion to be applied.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The results are unspecified if more than one flag character is specified, a flag character is specified without a minimum field width; a minimum field width is specified without a flag character; a modifier is specified with a flag or with a minimum field width; or if a minimum field width is specified for any conversion specifier other than <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, or <b>Y</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
All ordinary characters (including the terminating NUL character) are copied unchanged into the array. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. No more than maxsize bytes are placed into the array. Each conversion specifier is replaced by appropriate characters as described in the following list. The appropriate characters are determined using the <i>LC_TIME</i> category of the current locale and by the values of zero or more members of the broken-down time structure pointed to by <i>timeptr</i>, as specified in brackets in the description. If any of the specified values are outside the normal range, the characters stored are unspecified.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>strftime_l</i>() function shall be equivalent to the  <i>strftime</i>() function, except that the locale data used is from the locale represented by <i>locale</i>.<div class="spacer">

Some of the conversion specifications are duplicates of others. They are included for compatibility with  <i>nl_cxtime</i>() and  <i>nl_ascxtime</i>(), which were published in Issue 2.<div class="spacer">

The <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b> format specifiers in  <i>strftime</i>() always print full values, but the  <i>strptime</i>() <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, and <b>%Y</b> format specifiers only scan two digits (assumed to be the first two digits of a four-digit year) for <b>%C</b> and four digits (assumed to be the entire (four-digit) year) for <b>%F</b> and <b>%Y</b>.

when given <b>&quot;1000&quot;</b> as input will only store 10 in <i>x</i>). Applications using extended ranges of years must be sure that the number of digits specified for scanning years with  <i>strptime</i>() matches the number of digits that will actually be present in the input stream. Historic implementations of the <b>%Y</b> conversion specification (with no flags and no minimum field width) produced different output formats. Some always produced at least four digits (with 0 fill for years from 0 through 999) while others only produced the number of digits present in the year (with no fill and no padding). These two forms can be produced with the <b>'0'</b> flag and a minimum field width options using the conversions specifications <b>%04Y</b> and <b>%01Y</b>, respectively.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the past, the C and POSIX standards specified that <b>%F</b> produced an ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard date format, but didn't specify which one. For years in the range [0001,9999], POSIX.1&#8208;2008 requires that the output produced match the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard complete representation extended format (YYYY-MM-DD) and for years outside of this range produce output that matches the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard expanded representation extended format (&lt;+/-&gt;&lt;Underline&gt;Y&lt;/Underline&gt;YYYY-MM-DD). To fully meet ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard requirements, the producer and consumer must agree on a date format that has a specific number of bytes reserved to hold the characters used to represent the years that is sufficiently large to hold all values that will be shared. For example, the <b>%+13F</b> conversion specification will produce output matching the format <b>&quot;&lt;+/-&gt;YYYYYY-MM-DD&quot;</b> (a leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'&#8722;'</b> sign; a six-digit, 0-filled year; a <b>'&#8722;'</b>; a two-digit, leading 0-filled month; another <b>'&#8722;'</b>; and the two-digit, leading 0-filled day within the month).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that if the year being printed is greater than 9999, the resulting string from the unadorned <b>%F</b> conversion specifications will not conform to the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard extended format, complete representation for a date and will instead be an extended format, expanded representation (presumably without the required agreement between the date's producer and consumer).<div class="spacer">

<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The <b>%Y</b> conversion specification to  <i>strftime</i>() was frequently assumed to be a four-digit year, but the ISO&#160;C standard does not specify that <b>%Y</b> is restricted to any subset of allowed values from the <i>tm_year</i> field. Similarly, the <b>%C</b> conversion specification was assumed to be a two-digit field and the first part of the output from the <b>%F</b> conversion specification was assumed to be a four-digit field. With <i>tm_year</i> being a signed 32 or more-bit <b>int</b> and with many current implementations supporting 64-bit <b>time_t</b> types in one or more programming environments, these assumptions are clearly wrong.<div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX.1&#8208;2008 now allows the format specifications <b>%0xC</b>, <b>%0xF</b>, <b>%0xG</b>, and <b>%0xY</b> (where <b>'x'</b> is a string of decimal digits used to specify printing and scanning of a string of <i>x</i> decimal digits) with leading zero fill characters. Allowing applications to set the field width enables them to agree on the number of digits to be printed and scanned in the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard expanded representation of a year (for <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b>) or all but the last two digits of the year (for <b>%C</b>). This is based on a feature in some versions of GNU <b>libc</b>'s  <i>strftime</i>(). The GNU version allows specifying space, zero, or no-fill characters in  <i>strftime</i>() format strings, but does not allow any flags to be specified in  <i>strptime</i>() format strings. These implementations also allow these flags to be specified for any numeric field. POSIX.1&#8208;2008 only requires the zero fill flag (<b>'0'</b>) and only requires that it be recognized when processing <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b> specifications when a minimum field width is also specified. The <b>'0'</b> flag is the only flag needed to produce and scan the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard year fields using the extended format forms. POSIX.1&#8208;2008 also allows applications to specify the same flag and field width specifiers to be used in both  <i>strftime</i>() and  <i>strptime</i>() format strings for symmetry. Systems may provide other flag characters and may accept flags in conjunction with conversion specifiers other than <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b>; but portable applications cannot depend on such extensions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX.1&#8208;2008 now also allows the format specifications <b>%+xC</b>, <b>%+xF</b>, <b>%+xG</b>, and <b>%+xY</b> (where <b>'x'</b> is a string of decimal digits used to specify printing and scanning of a string of <b>'x'</b> decimal digits) with leading zero fill characters and a leading <b>'+'</b> sign character if the year being converted is more than four digits or a minimum field width is specified that allows room for more than four digits for the year. This allows date providers and consumers to agree on a specific number of digits to represent a year as required by the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard expanded representation formats. The expanded representation formats all require the year to begin with a leading <b>'+'</b> or <b>'&#8722;'</b> sign. (All of these specifiers can also provide a leading <b>'&#8722;'</b> sign for negative years. Since negative years and the year 0 don't fit well with the Gregorian or Julian calendars, the normal ranges of dates start with year 1. The ISO&#160;C standard allows <i>tm_year</i> to assume values corresponding to years before year 1, but the use of such years provided unspecified results.)<div class="spacer">
</div>
Some earlier version of this standard specified that applications wanting to use  <i>strptime</i>() to scan dates and times printed by  <i>strftime</i>() should provide non-digit characters between fields to separate years from months and days. It also supported <b>%F</b> to print and scan the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard extended format, complete representation date for years 1 through 9999 (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD). However, many applications were written to print (using  <i>strftime</i>()) and scan (using  <i>strptime</i>()) dates written using the basic format complete representation (four-digit years) and truncated representation (two-digit years) specified by the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard representation of dates and times which do not have any separation characters between fields. The ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard also specifies basic format expanded representation where the creator and consumer of these fields agree beforehand to represent years as leading zero-filled strings of an agreed length of more than four digits to represent a year (again with no separation characters when year, month, and day are all displayed). Applications producing and consuming expanded representations are encouraged to use the <b>'+'</b> flag and an appropriate maximum field width to scan the year including the leading sign. Note that even without the <b>'+'</b> flag, years less than zero may be represented with a leading minus-sign for <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>,<b>and</b> <b>%Y</b> conversion specifications. Using negative years results in unspecified behavior.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If a format specification <b>%+xF</b> with the field width <i>x</i> greater than 11 is specified and the width is large enough to display the full year, the output string produced will match the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard subclause 4.1.2.4 expanded representation, extended format date representation for a specific day. (For years in the range [1,99999], <b>%+12F</b> is sufficient for an agreed five-digit year with a leading sign using the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard expanded representation, extended format for a specific day <b>&quot;&lt;+/-&gt;YYYYY-MM-DD&quot;</b>.) Note also that years less than 0 may produce a leading minus-sign (<b>'&#8722;'</b>) when using <b>%Y</b> or <b>%C</b> whether or not the <b>'0'</b> or <b>'+'</b> flags are used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The difference between the <b>'0'</b> flag and the <b>'+'</b> flag is whether the leading <b>'+'</b> character will be provided for years &gt;9999 as required for the ISO&#160;8601:2004 standard extended representation format containing a year. For example:<table class="tbl">
<col style="width: 6.00ex;"/>
<col style="width: 24.00ex;"/>
<col style="width: 18.00ex;"/>
<col style="width: 18.00ex;"/>

In the cases above marked with a * in the  <i>strptime</i>() scan back field, the implied or specified number of characters scanned by  <i>strptime</i>() was less than the number of characters output by  <i>strftime</i>() using the same format; so the remaining digits of the year were dropped when the output date produced by  <i>strftime</i>() was scanned back in by  <i>strptime</i>().</div>
