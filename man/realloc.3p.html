<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&#160;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO&#160;C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 defers to the ISO&#160;C standard.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>realloc</i>() function shall deallocate the old object pointed to by <i>ptr</i> and return a pointer to a new object that has the size specified by <i>size</i>. The contents of the new object shall be the same as that of the old object prior to deallocation, up to the lesser of the new and old sizes. Any bytes in the new object beyond the size of the old object have indeterminate values. If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior shall be implementation-defined: either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior shall be as if the size were some non-zero value, except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object. If the space cannot be allocated, the object shall remain unchanged.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>ptr</i> is a null pointer,  <i>realloc</i>() shall be equivalent to  <i>malloc</i>() for the specified size.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>ptr</i> does not match a pointer returned earlier by  <i>calloc</i>(),  <i>malloc</i>(), or  <i>realloc</i>() or if the space has previously been deallocated by a call to  <i>free</i>() or  <i>realloc</i>(), the behavior is undefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to  <i>realloc</i>() is unspecified. The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object and then used to access such an object in the space allocated (until the space is explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to an object disjoint from any other object. The pointer returned shall point to the start (lowest byte address) of the allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer shall be returned.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion,  <i>realloc</i>() shall return a pointer to the (possibly moved) allocated space. If <i>size</i> is 0, either:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A null pointer shall be returned and <i>errno</i> set to an implementation-defined value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
A unique pointer that can be successfully passed to  <i>free</i>() shall be returned, and the memory object pointed to by <i>ptr</i> shall be freed. The application shall ensure that the pointer is not used to access an object.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If there is not enough available memory,  <i>realloc</i>() shall return a null pointer and set <i>errno</i> to <b>[ENOMEM]</b>. If  <i>realloc</i>() returns a null pointer and <i>errno</i> has been set to <b>[ENOMEM]</b>, the memory referenced by <i>ptr</i> shall not be changed.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>realloc</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOMEM</b></dt>
<dd>
Insufficient memory is available.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> The description of  <i>realloc</i>() has been modified from previous versions of this standard to align with the ISO/IEC&#160;9899:1999 standard. Previous versions explicitly permitted a call to <i>realloc</i>(<i>p</i><i>, 0) to free the space pointed to by</i> <i>p</i> and return a null pointer. While this behavior could be interpreted as permitted by this version of the standard, the C language committee have indicated that this interpretation is incorrect. Applications should assume that if  <i>realloc</i>() returns a null pointer, the space pointed to by <i>p</i> has not been freed. Since this could lead to double-frees, implementations should also set <i>errno</i> if a null pointer actually indicates a failure, and applications should only free the space if <i>errno</i> was changed.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h1> This standard defers to the ISO&#160;C standard. While that standard currently has language that might permit <i>realloc</i>(<i>p</i><i>, 0), where</i> <i>p</i> is not a null pointer, to free <i>p</i> while still returning a null pointer, the committee responsible for that standard is considering clarifying the language to explicitly prohibit that alternative.</div>
