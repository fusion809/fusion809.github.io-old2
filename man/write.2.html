<h1>NAME</h1> write - write to a file descriptor</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>ssize_t write(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, const void *</b><i>buf</i><b>, size_t </b><i>count</i><b>);</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>write</b>() writes up to <i>count</i> bytes from the buffer pointed <i>buf</i> to the file referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The number of bytes written may be less than <i>count</i> if, for example, there is insufficient space on the underlying physical medium, or the <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b> resource limit is encountered (see <b>setrlimit</b>(2)), or the call was interrupted by a signal handler after having written less than <i>count</i> bytes. (See also <b>pipe</b>(7).)<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
For a seekable file (i.e., one to which <b>lseek</b>(2) may be applied, for example, a regular file) writing takes place at the current file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes actually written. If the file was <b>open</b>(2)ed with <b>O_APPEND</b>, the file offset is first set to the end of the file before writing. The adjustment of the file offset and the write operation are performed as an atomic step.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
POSIX requires that a <b>read</b>(2) which can be proved to occur after a <b>write</b>() has returned returns the new data. Note that not all filesystems are POSIX conforming.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success, the number of bytes written is returned (zero indicates nothing was written). It is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes requested; this may happen for example because the disk device was filled. See also NOTES.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If <i>count</i> is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a regular file, then <b>write</b>() may return a failure status if one of the errors below is detected. If no errors are detected, 0 will be returned without causing any other effect. If  <i>count</i> is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a regular file, the results are not specified.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
The file descriptor <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a socket and has been marked nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the write would block. See <b>open</b>(2) for further details on the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b></dt>
<dd>
The file descriptor <i>fd</i> refers to a socket and has been marked nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), and the write would block. POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case, and does not require these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both possibilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EBADF</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EDESTADDRREQ</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> refers to a datagram socket for which a peer address has not been set using <b>connect</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EDQUOT</b></dt>
<dd>
The user's quota of disk blocks on the filesystem containing the file referred to by <i>fd</i> has been exhausted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EFAULT</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>buf</i> is outside your accessible address space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EFBIG</b></dt>
<dd>
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the implementation-defined maximum file size or the process's file size limit, or to write at a position past the maximum allowed offset.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINTR</b></dt>
<dd>
The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was written; see <b>signal</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> is attached to an object which is unsuitable for writing; or the file was opened with the <b>O_DIRECT</b> flag, and either the address specified in <i>buf</i>, the value specified in <i>count</i>, or the current file offset is not suitably aligned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EIO</b></dt>
<dd>
A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOSPC</b></dt>
<dd>
The device containing the file referred to by <i>fd</i> has no room for the data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPERM</b></dt>
<dd>
The operation was prevented by a file seal; see <b>fcntl</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EPIPE</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>fd</i> is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading end is closed. When this happens the writing process will also receive a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal. (Thus, the write return value is seen only if the program catches, blocks or ignores this signal.)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Other errors may occur, depending on the object connected to <i>fd</i>.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Under SVr4 a write may be interrupted and return <b>EINTR</b> at any point, not just before any data is written.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> A successful return from <b>write</b>() does not make any guarantee that data has been committed to disk. In fact, on some buggy implementations, it does not even guarantee that space has successfully been reserved for the data. The only way to be sure is to call <b>fsync</b>(2) after you are done writing all your data.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
If a <b>write</b>() is interrupted by a signal handler before any bytes are written, then the call fails with the error <b>EINTR</b>; if it is interrupted after at least one byte has been written, the call succeeds, and returns the number of bytes written.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
On Linux, <b>write</b>() (and similar system calls) will transfer at most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number of bytes actually transferred. (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>BUGS</h1> According to POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7 (&quot;Thread Interactions with Regular File Operations&quot;):<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
All of the following functions shall be atomic with respect to each other in the effects specified in POSIX.1-2008 when they operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Among the APIs subsequently listed are <b>write</b>() and <b>writev</b>(2). And among the effects that should be atomic across threads (and processes) are updates of the file offset. However, on Linux before version 3.14, this was not the case: if two processes that share an open file description (see <b>open</b>(2)) perform a <b>write</b>() (or <b>writev</b>(2)) at the same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic with respect updating the file offset, with the result that the blocks of data output by the two processes might (incorrectly) overlap. This problem was fixed in Linux 3.14.</div>
