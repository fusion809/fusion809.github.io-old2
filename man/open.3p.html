<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>open</i>() function shall establish the connection between a file and a file descriptor. It shall create an open file description that refers to a file and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file. The <i>path</i> argument points to a pathname naming the file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>open</i>() function shall return a file descriptor for the named file that is the lowest file descriptor not currently open for that process. The open file description is new, and therefore the file descriptor shall not share it with any other process in the system. The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor shall be cleared unless the O_CLOEXEC flag is set in <i>oflag</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The file offset used to mark the current position within the file shall be set to the beginning of the file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The file status flags and file access modes of the open file description shall be set according to the value of <i>oflag</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Values for <i>oflag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. Applications shall specify exactly one of the first five values (file access modes) below in the value of <i>oflag</i>:<dl>
<dt>
O_EXEC</dt>
<dd>
Open for execute only (non-directory files). The result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_RDONLY</dt>
<dd>
Open for reading only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_RDWR</dt>
<dd>
Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined if this flag is applied to a FIFO.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_SEARCH</dt>
<dd>
Open directory for search only. The result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a non-directory file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_WRONLY</dt>
<dd>
Open for writing only.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any combination of the following may be used:<dl>
<dt>
O_APPEND</dt>
<dd>
If set, the file offset shall be set to the end of the file prior to each write.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
O_CLOEXEC</dt>
<dd>
If set, the FD_CLOEXEC flag for the new file descriptor shall be set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
O_CREAT</dt>
<dd>
If the file exists, this flag has no effect except as noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise, the file shall be created; the user ID of the file shall be set to the effective user ID of the process; the group ID of the file shall be set to the group ID of the file's parent directory or to the effective group ID of the process; and the access permission bits (see <i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i>) of the file mode shall be set to the value of the argument following the <i>oflag</i> argument taken as type <b>mode_t</b> modified as follows: a bitwise AND is performed on the file-mode bits and the corresponding bits in the complement of the process' file mode creation mask. Thus, all bits in the file mode whose corresponding bit in the file mode creation mask is set are cleared. When bits other than the file permission bits are set, the effect is unspecified. The argument following the <i>oflag</i> argument does not affect whether the file is open for reading, writing, or for both. Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the file's group ID to the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide an implementation-defined way to initialize the file's group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.</dd>

If O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set,  <i>open</i>() shall fail if the file exists. The check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist shall be atomic with respect to other threads executing  <i>open</i>() naming the same filename in the same directory with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set.

O_NOCTTY</dt>

Read I/O operations on the file descriptor shall complete at the same level of integrity as specified by the O_DSYNC and O_SYNC flags.

O_TRUNC</dt>

If the file exists and is a regular file, and the file is successfully opened O_RDWR or O_WRONLY, its length shall be truncated to 0, and the mode and owner shall be unchanged.

The result of using O_TRUNC without either O_RDWR or O_WRONLY is undefined.</dd>

O_TTY_INIT</dt>
<dd>
If <i>path</i> identifies a terminal device other than a pseudo-terminal, the device is not already open in any process, and either O_TTY_INIT is set in <i>oflag</i> or O_TTY_INIT has the value zero,  <i>open</i>() shall set any non-standard <b>termios</b> structure terminal parameters to a state that provides conforming behavior; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, <i>Section 11.2</i>, <i>Parameters that Can be Set</i>. It is unspecified whether O_TTY_INIT has any effect if the device is already open in any process. If <i>path</i> identifies the slave side of a pseudo-terminal that is not already open in any process,  <i>open</i>() shall set any non-standard <b>termios</b> structure terminal parameters to a state that provides conforming behavior, regardless of whether O_TTY_INIT is set. If <i>path</i> does not identify a terminal device, O_TTY_INIT shall be ignored.</dd>

If <i>path</i> refers to a STREAMS file, <i>oflag</i> may be constructed from O_NONBLOCK OR'ed with either O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR. Other flag values are not applicable to STREAMS devices and shall have no effect on them. The value O_NONBLOCK affects the operation of STREAMS drivers and certain functions applied to file descriptors associated with STREAMS files. For STREAMS drivers, the implementation of O_NONBLOCK is device-specific.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The application shall ensure that it specifies the O_TTY_INIT flag on the first open of a terminal device since system boot or since the device was closed by the process that last had it open. The application need not specify the O_TTY_INIT flag when opening pseudo-terminals. If <i>path</i> names the master side of a pseudo-terminal device, then it is unspecified whether  <i>open</i>() locks the slave side so that it cannot be opened. Conforming applications shall call  <i>unlockpt</i>() before opening the slave side.<div class="spacer">

The largest value that can be represented correctly in an object of type <b>off_t</b> shall be established as the offset maximum in the open file description.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>openat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the  <i>open</i>() function except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path. In this case the file to be opened is determined relative to the directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the current working directory. If the file descriptor was opened without O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted using the current permissions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the file descriptor was opened with O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.<div class="spacer">

<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> POSIX.1&#8208;2008 does not require that terminal parameters be automatically set to any state on first open, nor that they be reset after the last close. It is possible for a non-conforming application to leave a terminal device in a state where the next process to use that device finds it in a non-conforming state, but has no way of determining this. To ensure that the device is set to a conforming initial state, applications which perform a first open of a terminal (other than a pseudo-terminal) should do so using the O_TTY_INIT flag to set the parameters associated with the terminal to a conforming state.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Except as specified in this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, the flags allowed in <i>oflag</i> are not mutually-exclusive and any number of them may be used simultaneously. Not all combinations of flags make sense. For example, using O_SEARCH | O_CREAT will successfully open a pre-existing directory for searching, but if there is no existing file by that name, then it is unspecified whether a regular file will be created. Likewise, if a non-directory file descriptor is successfully returned, it is unspecified whether that descriptor will have execute permissions as if by O_EXEC (note that it is unspecified whether O_EXEC and O_SEARCH have the same value).</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Some implementations permit opening FIFOs with O_RDWR. Since FIFOs could be implemented in other ways, and since two file descriptors can be used to the same effect, this possibility is left as undefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
See <i><i>getgroups</i>()</i> about the group of a newly created file.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of  <i>open</i>() to create a regular file is preferable to the use of  <i>creat</i>(), because the latter is redundant and included only for historical reasons.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of the O_TRUNC flag on FIFOs and directories (pipes cannot be  <i>open</i>()-ed) must be permissible without unexpected side-effects (for example,  <i>creat</i>() on a FIFO must not remove data). Since terminal special files might have type-ahead data stored in the buffer, O_TRUNC should not affect their content, particularly if a program that normally opens a regular file should open the current controlling terminal instead. Other file types, particularly implementation-defined ones, are left implementation-defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
POSIX.1&#8208;2008 permits <b>[EACCES]</b> to be returned for conditions other than those explicitly listed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The O_NOCTTY flag was added to allow applications to avoid unintentionally acquiring a controlling terminal as a side-effect of opening a terminal file. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 does not specify how a controlling terminal is acquired, but it allows an implementation to provide this on  <i>open</i>() if the O_NOCTTY flag is not set and other conditions specified in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i> are met.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In historical implementations the value of O_RDONLY is zero. Because of that, it is not possible to detect the presence of O_RDONLY and another option. Future implementations should encode O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY as bit flags so that:<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY == O_RDWR</b><br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
O_EXEC and O_SEARCH are specified as two of the five file access modes. Since O_EXEC does not apply to directories, and O_SEARCH only applies to directories, their values need not be distinct. Since O_RDONLY has historically had the value zero, implementations are not able to distinguish between O_SEARCH and O_SEARCH | O_RDONLY, and similarly for O_EXEC.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In general, the  <i>open</i>() function follows the symbolic link if <i>path</i> names a symbolic link. However, the  <i>open</i>() function, when called with O_CREAT and O_EXCL, is required to fail with <b>[EEXIST]</b> if <i>path</i> names an existing symbolic link, even if the symbolic link refers to a nonexistent file. This behavior is required so that privileged applications can create a new file in a known location without the possibility that a symbolic link might cause the file to be created in a different location.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, a privileged application that must create a file with a predictable name in a user-writable directory, such as the user's home directory, could be compromised if the user creates a symbolic link with that name that refers to a nonexistent file in a system directory. If the user can influence the contents of a file, the user could compromise the system by creating a new system configuration or spool file that would then be interpreted by the system. The test for a symbolic link which refers to a nonexisting file must be atomic with the creation of a new file.<div class="spacer">

In addition, the  <i>open</i>() function refuses to open non-directories if the O_DIRECTORY flag is set. This avoids race conditions whereby a user might compromise the system by substituting a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., a device or a FIFO) while a privileged application is running, where opening a file even for read access might have undesirable side-effects.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition, the  <i>open</i>() function does not follow symbolic links if the O_NOFOLLOW flag is set. This avoids race conditions whereby a user might compromise the system by substituting a symbolic link to a sensitive file (e.g., a device) while a privileged application is running, where opening a file even for read access might have undesirable side-effects.<div class="spacer">

The POSIX.1&#8208;1990 standard required that the group ID of a newly created file be set to the group ID of its parent directory or to the effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151&#8208;2 required that implementations provide a way to have the group ID be set to the group ID of the containing directory, but did not prohibit implementations also supporting a way to set the group ID to the effective group ID of the creating process. Conforming applications should not assume which group ID will be used. If it matters, an application can use  <i>chown</i>() to set the group ID after the file is created, or determine under what conditions the implementation will set the desired group ID.<div class="spacer">

The purpose of the  <i>openat</i>() function is to enable opening files in directories other than the current working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to  <i>open</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the target directory and using the  <i>openat</i>() function it can be guaranteed that the opened file is located relative to the desired directory. Some implementations use the  <i>openat</i>() function for other purposes as well. In some cases, if the <i>oflag</i> parameter has the O_XATTR bit set, the returned file descriptor provides access to extended attributes. This functionality is not standardized here.</div>
