<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The <i>od</i> utility shall write the contents of its input files to standard output in a user-specified format.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>OPTIONS</h1> The <i>od</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except that the order of presentation of the <b>&#8722;t</b> options and the <b>&#8722;bcdosx</b> options is significant.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The following options shall be supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;A&#160;</b><i>address_base</i></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
Specify the input offset base. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section. The application shall ensure that the <i>address_base</i> option-argument is a character. The characters <b>'d'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, and <b>'x'</b> specify that the offset base shall be written in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, respectively. The character <b>'n'</b> specifies that the offset shall not be written.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;b</b></dt>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;c</b></dt>
<dd>
Interpret bytes as characters specified by the current setting of the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> category. Certain non-graphic characters appear as C escapes: <b>&quot;NUL=\0&quot;</b>, <b>&quot;BS=\b&quot;</b>, <b>&quot;FF=\f&quot;</b>, <b>&quot;NL=\n&quot;</b>, <b>&quot;CR=\r&quot;</b>, <b>&quot;HT=\t&quot;</b>; others appear as 3-digit octal numbers.</dd>

Interpret <i>word</i>s (two-byte units) in unsigned decimal. This shall be equivalent to <b>&#8722;t&#160;u2</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;j&#160;</b><i>skip</i></dt>
<dd>
Jump over <i>skip</i> bytes from the beginning of the input. The <i>od</i> utility shall read or seek past the first <i>skip</i> bytes in the concatenated input files. If the combined input is not at least <i>skip</i> bytes long, the <i>od</i> utility shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a non-zero exit status.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 10.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
By default, the <i>skip</i> option-argument shall be interpreted as a decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X, the offset shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading <b>'0'</b>, the offset shall be interpreted as an octal number. Appending the character <b>'b'</b>, <b>'k'</b>, or <b>'m'</b> to offset shall cause it to be interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576 bytes, respectively. If the <i>skip</i> number is hexadecimal, any appended <b>'b'</b> shall be considered to be the final hexadecimal digit.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>&#8722;N&#160;</b><i>count</i></dt>
<dd>
Format no more than <i>count</i> bytes of input. By default, <i>count</i> shall be interpreted as a decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X, <i>count</i> shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading <b>'0'</b>, it shall be interpreted as an octal number. If <i>count</i> bytes of input (after successfully skipping, if <b>&#8722;j</b> <i>skip</i> is specified) are not available, it shall not be considered an error; the <i>od</i> utility shall format the input that is available.</dd>

The number of bytes transformed by the output type specifier <b>c</b> may be variable depending on the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> category.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The default number of bytes transformed by output type specifiers <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b> corresponds to the various C-language types as follows. If the <i>c99</i> compiler is present on the system, these specifiers shall correspond to the sizes used by default in that compiler. Otherwise, these sizes may vary among systems that conform to POSIX.1&#8208;2008.<dl>

<dd>
For the type specifier characters <b>d</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b>, the default number of bytes shall correspond to the size of the underlying implementation's basic integer type. For these specifier characters, the implementation shall support values of the optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding to the number of bytes in the C-language types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>. These numbers can also be specified by an application as the characters <b>'C'</b>, <b>'S'</b>, <b>'I'</b>, and <b>'L'</b>, respectively. The implementation shall also support the values 1, 2, 4, and 8, even if it provides no C-Language types of those sizes. The implementation shall support the decimal value corresponding to the C-language type <b>long long</b>. The byte order used when interpreting numeric values is implementation-defined, but shall correspond to the order in which a constant of the corresponding type is stored in memory on the system.</dd>

The type specifier character <b>c</b> specifies that bytes shall be interpreted as characters specified by the current setting of the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> locale category. Characters listed in the table in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, <i>Chapter 5</i>, <i>File Format Notation</i> (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>) shall be written as the corresponding escape sequences, except that &lt;backslash&gt; shall be written as a single &lt;backslash&gt; and a NUL shall be written as <b>'\0'</b>. Other non-printable characters shall be written as one three-digit octal number for each byte in the character. Printable multi-byte characters shall be written in the area corresponding to the first byte of the character; the two-character sequence <b>&quot;**&quot;</b> shall be written in the area corresponding to each remaining byte in the character, as an indication that the character is continued. When either the <b>&#8722;j</b> <i>skip</i> or <b>&#8722;N</b> <i>count</i> option is specified along with the <b>c</b> type specifier, and this results in an attempt to start or finish in the middle of a multi-byte character, the result is implementation-defined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The input data shall be manipulated in blocks, where a block is defined as a multiple of the least common multiple of the number of bytes transformed by the specified output types. If the least common multiple is greater than 16, the results are unspecified. Each input block shall be written as transformed by each output type, one per written line, in the order that the output types were specified. If the input block size is larger than the number of bytes transformed by the output type, the output type shall sequentially transform the parts of the input block, and the output from each of the transformations shall be separated by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If, as a result of the specification of the <b>&#8722;N</b> option or end-of-file being reached on the last input file, input data only partially satisfies an output type, the input shall be extended sufficiently with null bytes to write the last byte of the input.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Unless <b>&#8722;A&#160;n</b> is specified, the first output line produced for each input block shall be preceded by the input offset, cumulative across input files, of the next byte to be written. The format of the input offset is unspecified; however, it shall not contain any &lt;blank&gt; characters, shall start at the first character of the output line, and shall be followed by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters. In addition, the offset of the byte following the last byte written shall be written after all the input data has been processed, but shall not be followed by any &lt;blank&gt; characters.<div class="spacer">

<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> XSI-conformant applications are warned not to use filenames starting with <b>'+'</b> or a first operand starting with a numeric character so that the old functionality can be maintained by implementations, unless they specify one of the <b>&#8722;A</b>, <b>&#8722;j</b>, or <b>&#8722;N</b> options. To guarantee that one of these filenames is always interpreted as a filename, an application could always specify the address base format with the <b>&#8722;A</b> option.</div>

<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The <i>od</i> utility went through several names in early proposals, including <i>hd</i>, <i>xd</i>, and most recently <i>hexdump</i>. There were several objections to all of these based on the following reasons:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The <i>hd</i> and <i>xd</i> names conflicted with historical utilities that behaved differently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The <i>hexdump</i> description was much more complex than needed for a simple dump utility.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The <i>od</i> utility has been available on all historical implementations and there was no need to create a new name for a utility so similar to the historical <i>od</i> utility.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The original reasons for not standardizing historical <i>od</i> were also fairly widespread. Those reasons are given below along with rationale explaining why the standard developers believe that this version does not suffer from the indicated problem:<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The BSD and System V versions of <i>od</i> have diverged, and the intersection of features provided by both does not meet the needs of the user community. In fact, the System V version only provides a mechanism for dumping octal bytes and <b>short</b>s, signed and unsigned decimal <b>short</b>s, hexadecimal <b>short</b>s, and ASCII characters. BSD added the ability to dump <b>float</b>s, <b>double</b>s, named ASCII characters, and octal, signed decimal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal <b>long</b>s. The version presented here provides more normalized forms for dumping bytes, <b>short</b>s, <b>int</b>s, and <b>long</b>s in octal, signed decimal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal; <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long double</b>; and named ASCII as well as current locale characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
It would not be possible to come up with a compatible superset of the BSD and System V flags that met the requirements of the standard developers. The historical default <i>od</i> output is the specified default output of this utility. None of the option letters chosen for this version of <i>od</i> conflict with any of the options to historical versions of <i>od</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
On systems with different sizes for <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>, there was no way to ask for dumps of <b>int</b>s, even in the BSD version. Because of the way options are named, the name space could not be extended to solve these problems. This is why the <b>&#8722;t</b> option was added (with type specifiers more closely matched to the  <i>printf</i>() formats used in the rest of this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008) and the optional field sizes were added to the <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b> type specifiers. It is also one of the reasons why the historical practice was not mandated as a required obsolescent form of <i>od</i>. (Although the old versions of <i>od</i> are not listed as an obsolescent form, implementations are urged to continue to recognize the older forms for several more years.) The <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, and <b>x</b> types match the meaning of the corresponding format characters in the historical implementations of <i>od</i> except for the default sizes of the fields converted. The <b>d</b> format is signed in this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 to match the  <i>printf</i>() notation. (Historical versions of <i>od</i> used <b>d</b> as a synonym for <b>u</b> in this version. The System V implementation uses <b>s</b> for signed decimal; BSD uses <b>i</b> for signed decimal and <b>s</b> for null-terminated strings.) Other than <b>d</b> and <b>u</b>, all of the type specifiers match format characters in the historical BSD version of <b>od</b>.</dd>

</div>
The sizes of the C-language types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long double</b> are used even though it is recognized that there may be zero or more than one compiler for the C language on an implementation and that they may use different sizes for some of these types. (For example, one compiler might use 2 bytes <b>short</b>s, 2 bytes <b>int</b>s, and 4 bytes <b>long</b>s, while another compiler (or an option to the same compiler) uses 2 bytes <b>short</b>s, 4 bytes <b>int</b>s, and 4 bytes <b>long</b>s.) Nonetheless, there has to be a basic size known by the implementation for these types, corresponding to the values reported by invocations of the <i>getconf</i> utility when called with <i>system_var</i> operands {UCHAR_MAX}, {USHORT_MAX}, {UINT_MAX}, and {ULONG_MAX} for the types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>, respectively. There are similar constants required by the ISO&#160;C standard, but not required by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 or this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008. They are {FLT_MANT_DIG}, {DBL_MANT_DIG}, and {LDBL_MANT_DIG} for the types <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long double</b>, respectively. If the optional <i>c99</i> utility is provided by the implementation and used as specified by this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008, these are the sizes that would be provided. If an option is used that specifies different sizes for these types, there is no guarantee that the <i>od</i> utility is able to interpret binary data output by such a program correctly.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 requires that the numeric values of these lengths be recognized by the <i>od</i> utility and that symbolic forms also be recognized. Thus, a conforming application can always look at an array of <b>unsigned long</b> data elements using <i>od</i> <b>&#8722;t</b> <i>uL</i>.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
 *</dt>
<dd>
The method of specifying the format for the address field based on specifying a starting offset in a file unnecessarily tied the two together. The <b>&#8722;A</b> option now specifies the address base and the <b>&#8722;S</b> option specifies a starting offset.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>
It would be difficult to break the dependence on US ASCII to achieve an internationalized utility. It does not seem to be any harder for <i>od</i> to dump characters in the current locale than it is for the <i>ed</i> or <i>sed</i> <b>l</b> commands. The <b>c</b> type specifier does this without difficulty and is completely compatible with the historical implementations of the <b>c</b> format character when the current locale uses a superset of the ISO/IEC&#160;646:1991 standard as a codeset. The <b>a</b> type specifier (from the BSD <b>a</b> format character) was left as a portable means to dump ASCII (or more correctly ISO/IEC&#160;646:1991 standard (IRV)) so that headers produced by <i>pax</i> could be deciphered even on systems that do not use the ISO/IEC&#160;646:1991 standard as a subset of their base codeset.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of <b>&quot;**&quot;</b> as an indication of continuation of a multi-byte character in <b>c</b> specifier output was chosen based on seeing an implementation that uses this method. The continuation bytes have to be marked in a way that is not ambiguous with another single-byte or multi-byte character.<div class="spacer">
</div>
An early proposal used <b>&#8722;S</b> and <b>&#8722;n</b>, respectively, for the <b>&#8722;j</b> and <b>&#8722;N</b> options eventually selected. These were changed to avoid conflicts with historical implementations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The original standard specified <b>&#8722;t o2</b> as the default when no output type was given. This was changed to <b>&#8722;t oS</b> (the length of a <b>short</b>) to accommodate a supercomputer implementation that historically used 64 bits as its default (and that defined shorts as 64 bits). This change should not affect conforming applications. The requirement to support lengths of 1, 2, and 4 was added at the same time to address an historical implementation that had no two-byte data types in its C compiler.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The use of a basic integer data type is intended to allow the implementation to choose a word size commonly used by applications on that architecture.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in this version.</div>
