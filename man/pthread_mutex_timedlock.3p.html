<h1>NAME</h1> pthread_mutex_timedlock &#8212; lock a mutex</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;<br/>
#include &lt;time.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int pthread_mutex_timedlock(pthread_mutex_t *restrict <i>mutex</i>,<br/>
    const struct timespec *restrict <i>abstime</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() function shall lock the mutex object referenced by <i>mutex</i>. If the mutex is already locked, the calling thread shall block until the mutex becomes available as in the  <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() function. If the mutex cannot be locked without waiting for another thread to unlock the mutex, this wait shall be terminated when the specified timeout expires.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i> passes, as measured by the clock on which timeouts are based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds <i>abstime</i>), or if the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i> has already been passed at the time of the call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. The resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock on which it is based. The <b>timespec</b> data type is defined in the <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> header.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout if the mutex can be locked immediately. The validity of the <i>abstime</i> parameter need not be checked if the mutex can be locked immediately.<div class="spacer">
</div>
As a consequence of the priority inheritance rules (for mutexes initialized with the PRIO_INHERIT protocol), if a timed mutex wait is terminated because its timeout expires, the priority of the owner of the mutex shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect the fact that this thread is no longer among the threads waiting for the mutex.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>mutex</i> is a robust mutex and the process containing the owning thread terminated while holding the mutex lock, a call to  <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() shall return the error value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>. If <i>mutex</i> is a robust mutex and the owning thread terminated while holding the mutex lock, a call to  <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() may return the error value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b> even if the process in which the owning thread resides has not terminated. In these cases, the mutex is locked by the thread but the state it protects is marked as inconsistent. The application should ensure that the state is made consistent for reuse and when that is complete call  <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>(). If the application is unable to recover the state, it should unlock the mutex without a prior call to  <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>(), after which the mutex is marked permanently unusable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>mutex</i> does not refer to an initialized mutex object, the behavior is undefined.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If successful, the  <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>

<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>

The mutex could not be acquired because the maximum number of recursive locks for <i>mutex</i> has been exceeded.</dd>

The mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK and the current thread already owns the mutex.</dd>

The mutex was created with the protocol attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT and the calling thread's priority is higher than the mutex' current priority ceiling.</dd>

<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The process or thread would have blocked, and the <i>abstime</i> parameter specified a nanoseconds field value less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.</dd>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> Applications that have assumed that non-zero return values are errors will need updating for use with robust mutexes, since a valid return for a thread acquiring a mutex which is protecting a currently inconsistent state is <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>. Applications that do not check the error returns, due to ruling out the possibility of such errors arising, should not use robust mutexes. If an application is supposed to work with normal and robust mutexes, it should check all return values for error conditions and if necessary take appropriate action.</div>
