<h1>NAME</h1> cfgetispeed &#8212; get input baud rate</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;termios.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
speed_t cfgetispeed(const struct termios *<i>termios_p</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>cfgetispeed</i>() function shall extract the input baud rate from the <b>termios</b> structure to which the <i>termios_p</i> argument points.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This function shall return exactly the value in the <b>termios</b> data structure, without interpretation.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> Upon successful completion,  <i>cfgetispeed</i>() shall return a value of type <b>speed_t</b> representing the input baud rate.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> No errors are defined.<div class="spacer">

<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The term ``baud'' is used historically here, but is not technically correct. This is properly ``bits per second'', which may not be the same as baud. However, the term is used because of the historical usage and understanding.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The  <i>cfgetospeed</i>(),  <i>cfgetispeed</i>(),  <i>cfsetospeed</i>(), and  <i>cfsetispeed</i>() functions do not take arguments as numbers, but rather as symbolic names. There are two reasons for this:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
Historically, numbers were not used because of the way the rate was stored in the data structure. This is retained even though a function is now used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
More importantly, only a limited set of possible rates is at all portable, and this constrains the application to that set.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
There is nothing to prevent an implementation accepting as an extension a number (such as 126), and since the encoding of the Bxxx symbols is not specified, this can be done to avoid introducing ambiguity.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Setting the input baud rate to zero was a mechanism to allow for split baud rates. Clarifications in this volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 have made it possible to determine whether split rates are supported and to support them without having to treat zero as a special case. Since this functionality is also confusing, it has been declared obsolescent. The 0 argument referred to is the literal constant 0, not the symbolic constant B0. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 does not preclude B0 from being defined as the value 0; in fact, implementations would likely benefit from the two being equivalent. This volume of POSIX.1&#8208;2008 does not fully specify whether the previous  <i>cfsetispeed</i>() value is retained after a  <i>tcgetattr</i>() as the actual value or as zero. Therefore, conforming applications should always set both the input speed and output speed when setting either.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In historical implementations, the baud rate information is traditionally kept in <b>c_cflag</b>. Applications should be written to presume that this might be the case (and thus not blindly copy <b>c_cflag</b>), but not to rely on it in case it is in some other field of the structure. Setting the <b>c_cflag</b> field absolutely after setting a baud rate is a non-portable action because of this. In general, the unused parts of the flag fields might be used by the implementation and should not be blindly copied from the descriptions of one terminal device to another.</div>
