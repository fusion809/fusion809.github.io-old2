<h1>NAME</h1> pthread_detach &#8212; detach a thread</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int pthread_detach(pthread_t <i>thread</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>pthread_detach</i>() function shall indicate to the implementation that storage for the thread <i>thread</i> can be reclaimed when that thread terminates. If <i>thread</i> has not terminated,  <i>pthread_detach</i>() shall not cause it to terminate.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>thread</i> argument to  <i>pthread_detach</i>() does not refer to a joinable thread.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If the call succeeds,  <i>pthread_detach</i>() shall return 0; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>pthread_detach</i>() function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<i>The following sections are informative.</i></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>APPLICATION USAGE</h1> None.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> The  <i>pthread_join</i>() or  <i>pthread_detach</i>() functions should eventually be called for every thread that is created so that storage associated with the thread may be reclaimed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
It has been suggested that a ``detach'' function is not necessary; the <i>detachstate</i> thread creation attribute is sufficient, since a thread need never be dynamically detached. However, need arises in at least two cases:<dl>
<dt>
 1.</dt>
<dd>
In a cancellation handler for a  <i>pthread_join</i>() it is nearly essential to have a  <i>pthread_detach</i>() function in order to detach the thread on which  <i>pthread_join</i>() was waiting. Without it, it would be necessary to have the handler do another  <i>pthread_join</i>() to attempt to detach the thread, which would both delay the cancellation processing for an unbounded period and introduce a new call to  <i>pthread_join</i>(), which might itself need a cancellation handler. A dynamic detach is nearly essential in this case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
 2.</dt>
<dd>
In order to detach the ``initial thread'' (as may be desirable in processes that set up server threads).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>thread</i> argument to  <i>pthread_detach</i>() does not refer to a joinable thread, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[ESRCH]</b> error.</div>
