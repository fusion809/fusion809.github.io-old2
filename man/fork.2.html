<h1>NAME</h1> fork - create a child process</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1> <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b><div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
<b>pid_t fork(void);</b></div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> <b>fork</b>() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is referred to as the <i>child</i> process. The calling process is referred to as the <i>parent</i> process.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The child process and the parent process run in separate memory spaces. At the time of <b>fork</b>() both memory spaces have the same content. Memory writes, file mappings (<b>mmap</b>(2)), and unmappings (<b>munmap</b>(2)) performed by one of the processes do not affect the other.<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
The child process is an exact duplicate of the parent process except for the following points:<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child has its own unique process ID, and this PID does not match the ID of any existing process group (<b>setpgid</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child's parent process ID is the same as the parent's process ID.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child does not inherit its parent's memory locks (<b>mlock</b>(2), <b>mlockall</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
Process resource utilizations (<b>getrusage</b>(2)) and CPU time counters (<b>times</b>(2)) are reset to zero in the child.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child's set of pending signals is initially empty (<b>sigpending</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child does not inherit semaphore adjustments from its parent (<b>semop</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child does not inherit process-associated record locks from its parent (<b>fcntl</b>(2)). (On the other hand, it does inherit <b>fcntl</b>(2) open file description locks and <b>flock</b>(2) locks from its parent.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child does not inherit timers from its parent (<b>setitimer</b>(2), <b>alarm</b>(2), <b>timer_create</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child does not inherit outstanding asynchronous I/O operations from its parent (<b>aio_read</b>(3), <b>aio_write</b>(3)), nor does it inherit any asynchronous I/O contexts from its parent (see <b>io_setup</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The process attributes in the preceding list are all specified in POSIX.1. The parent and child also differ with respect to the following Linux-specific process attributes:<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child does not inherit directory change notifications (dnotify) from its parent (see the description of <b>F_NOTIFY</b> in <b>fcntl</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</b> setting is reset so that the child does not receive a signal when its parent terminates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The default timer slack value is set to the parent's current timer slack value. See the description of <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</b> in <b>prctl</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
Memory mappings that have been marked with the <b>madvise</b>(2) <b>MADV_DONTFORK</b> flag are not inherited across a <b>fork</b>().</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The termination signal of the child is always <b>SIGCHLD</b> (see <b>clone</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The port access permission bits set by <b>ioperm</b>(2) are not inherited by the child; the child must turn on any bits that it requires using <b>ioperm</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note the following further points:<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child process is created with a single thread&#8212;the one that called <b>fork</b>(). The entire virtual address space of the parent is replicated in the child, including the states of mutexes, condition variables, and other pthreads objects; the use of <b>pthread_atfork</b>(3) may be helpful for dealing with problems that this can cause.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open file descriptors. Each file descriptor in the child refers to the same open file description (see <b>open</b>(2)) as the corresponding file descriptor in the parent. This means that the two descriptors share open file status flags, current file offset, and signal-driven I/O attributes (see the description of <b>F_SETOWN</b> and <b>F_SETSIG</b> in <b>fcntl</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open message queue descriptors (see <b>mq_overview</b>(7)). Each descriptor in the child refers to the same open message queue description as the corresponding descriptor in the parent. This means that the two descriptors share the same flags (<i>mq_flags</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
*</dt>
<dd>
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open directory streams (see <b>opendir</b>(3)). POSIX.1 says that the corresponding directory streams in the parent and child <i>may</i> share the directory stream positioning; on Linux/glibc they do not.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.</div>

<h1>ERRORS</h1><dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">
&#160;</div>
A system-imposed limit on the number of threads was encountered. There are a number of limits that may trigger this error: the <b>RLIMIT_NPROC</b> soft resource limit (set via <b>setrlimit</b>(2)), which limits the number of processes and threads for a real user ID, was reached; the kernel's system-wide limit on the number of processes and threads, <i>/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max</i>, was reached (see <b>proc</b>(5)); or the maximum number of PIDs, <i>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max</i>, was reached (see <b>proc</b>(5)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
The caller is operating under the <b>SCHED_DEADLINE</b> scheduling policy and does not have the reset-on-fork flag set. See <b>sched</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOMEM</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>fork</b>() failed to allocate the necessary kernel structures because memory is tight.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ENOSYS</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>fork</b>() is not supported on this platform (for example, hardware without a Memory-Management Unit).</dd>

<h1>CONFORMING TO</h1> POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>NOTES</h1> Under Linux, <b>fork</b>() is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty that it incurs is the time and memory required to duplicate the parent's page tables, and to create a unique task structure for the child.<div class="subsection">
<h2>C library/kernel differences</h2> Since version 2.3.3, rather than invoking the kernel's <b>fork</b>() system call, the glibc <b>fork</b>() wrapper that is provided as part of the NPTL threading implementation invokes <b>clone</b>(2) with flags that provide the same effect as the traditional system call. (A call to <b>fork</b>() is equivalent to a call to <b>clone</b>(2) specifying <i>flags</i> as just <b>SIGCHLD</b>.) The glibc wrapper invokes any fork handlers that have been established using <b>pthread_atfork</b>(3).</div>
