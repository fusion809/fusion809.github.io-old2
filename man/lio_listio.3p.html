<h1>NAME</h1> lio_listio &#8212; list directed I/O</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;aio.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int lio_listio(int <i>mode</i>, struct aiocb *restrict const <i>list</i>[restrict],<br/>
    int <i>nent</i>, struct sigevent *restrict <i>sig</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>lio_listio</i>() function shall initiate a list of I/O requests with a single function call.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mode</i> argument takes one of the values LIO_WAIT or LIO_NOWAIT declared in <i>&lt;aio.h&gt;</i> and determines whether the function returns when the I/O operations have been completed, or as soon as the operations have been queued. If the <i>mode</i> argument is LIO_WAIT, the function shall wait until all I/O is complete and the <i>sig</i> argument shall be ignored.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <i>mode</i> argument is LIO_NOWAIT, the function shall return immediately, and asynchronous notification shall occur, according to the <i>sig</i> argument, when all the I/O operations complete. If <i>sig</i> is NULL, then no asynchronous notification shall occur. If <i>sig</i> is not NULL, asynchronous notification occurs as specified in <i>Section 2.4.1</i>, <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i> when all the requests in <i>list</i> have completed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The I/O requests enumerated by <i>list</i> are submitted in an unspecified order.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>list</i> argument is an array of pointers to <b>aiocb</b> structures. The array contains <i>nent</i> elements. The array may contain NULL elements, which shall be ignored.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the buffer pointed to by <i>list</i> or the <b>aiocb</b> structures pointed to by the elements of the array <i>list</i> become illegal addresses before all asynchronous I/O completed and, if necessary, the notification is sent, then the behavior is undefined. If the buffers pointed to by the <i>aio_buf</i> member of the <b>aiocb</b> structure pointed to by the elements of the array <i>list</i> become illegal addresses prior to the asynchronous I/O associated with that <b>aiocb</b> structure being completed, the behavior is undefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> field of each <b>aiocb</b> structure specifies the operation to be performed. The supported operations are LIO_READ, LIO_WRITE, and LIO_NOP; these symbols are defined in <i>&lt;aio.h&gt;</i>. The LIO_NOP operation causes the list entry to be ignored. If the <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> element is equal to LIO_READ, then an I/O operation is submitted as if by a call to  <i>aio_read</i>() with the <i>aiocbp</i> equal to the address of the <b>aiocb</b> structure. If the <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> element is equal to LIO_WRITE, then an I/O operation is submitted as if by a call to  <i>aio_write</i>() with the <i>aiocbp</i> equal to the address of the <b>aiocb</b> structure.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>aio_fildes</i> member specifies the file descriptor on which the operation is to be performed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>aio_buf</i> member specifies the address of the buffer to or from which the data is transferred.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>aio_nbytes</i> member specifies the number of bytes of data to be transferred.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The members of the <b>aiocb</b> structure further describe the I/O operation to be performed, in a manner identical to that of the corresponding <b>aiocb</b> structure when used by the  <i>aio_read</i>() and  <i>aio_write</i>() functions.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>nent</i> argument specifies how many elements are members of the list; that is, the length of the array.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The behavior of this function is altered according to the definitions of synchronized I/O data integrity completion and synchronized I/O file integrity completion if synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associated with <i>aio_fildes</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum established in the open file description associated with  <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>sig</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify</i> is SIGEV_THREAD and  <i>sig</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> is a non-null pointer and the block pointed to by this pointer becomes an illegal address prior to all asynchronous I/O being completed, then the behavior is undefined.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> If the <i>mode</i> argument has the value LIO_NOWAIT, the  <i>lio_listio</i>() function shall return the value zero if the I/O operations are successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall return the value &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the <i>mode</i> argument has the value LIO_WAIT, the  <i>lio_listio</i>() function shall return the value zero when all the indicated I/O has completed successfully. Otherwise,  <i>lio_listio</i>() shall return a value of &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
In either case, the return value only indicates the success or failure of the  <i>lio_listio</i>() call itself, not the status of the individual I/O requests. In some cases one or more of the I/O requests contained in the list may fail. Failure of an individual request does not prevent completion of any other individual request. To determine the outcome of each I/O request, the application shall examine the error status associated with each <b>aiocb</b> control block. The error statuses so returned are identical to those returned as the result of an  <i>aio_read</i>() or  <i>aio_write</i>() function.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>lio_listio</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
The resources necessary to queue all the I/O requests were not available. The application may check the error status for each <b>aiocb</b> to determine the individual request(s) that failed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of entries indicated by <i>nent</i> would cause the system-wide limit {AIO_MAX} to be exceeded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The <i>mode</i> argument is not a proper value, or the value of <i>nent</i> was greater than {AIO_LISTIO_MAX}.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINTR</b></dt>
<dd>
A signal was delivered while waiting for all I/O requests to complete during an LIO_WAIT operation. Note that, since each I/O operation invoked by  <i>lio_listio</i>() may possibly provoke a signal when it completes, this error return may be caused by the completion of one (or more) of the very I/O operations being awaited. Outstanding I/O requests are not canceled, and the application shall examine each list element to determine whether the request was initiated, canceled, or completed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EIO</b></dt>
<dd>
One or more of the individual I/O operations failed. The application may check the error status for each <b>aiocb</b> structure to determine the individual request(s) that failed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In addition to the errors returned by the  <i>lio_listio</i>() function, if the  <i>lio_listio</i>() function succeeds or fails with errors of <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, <b>[EINTR]</b>, or <b>[EIO]</b>, then some of the I/O specified by the list may have been initiated. If the  <i>lio_listio</i>() function fails with an error code other than <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, <b>[EINTR]</b>, or <b>[EIO]</b>, no operations from the list shall have been initiated. The I/O operation indicated by each list element can encounter errors specific to the individual read or write function being performed. In this event, the error status for each <b>aiocb</b> control block contains the associated error code. The error codes that can be set are the same as would be set by a  <i>read</i>() or  <i>write</i>() function, with the following additional error codes possible:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
The requested I/O operation was not queued due to resource limitations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ECANCELED</b></dt>
<dd>
The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed due to an explicit  <i>aio_cancel</i>() request.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EFBIG</b></dt>
<dd>
The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_lio_opcode</i> is LIO_WRITE, the file is a regular file,  <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is greater than 0, and the  <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> is greater than or equal to the offset maximum in the open file description associated with  <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINPROGRESS</b></dt>
<dd>
The requested I/O is in progress.</dd>

<b>EOVERFLOW</b></dt>
<dd>
The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_lio_opcode</i> is LIO_READ, the file is a regular file,  <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is greater than 0, and the  <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> is before the end-of-file and is greater than or equal to the offset maximum in the open file description associated with  <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.</dd>

<div class="section">
<h1>RATIONALE</h1> Although it may appear that there are inconsistencies in the specified circumstances for error codes, the <b>[EIO]</b> error condition applies when any circumstance relating to an individual operation makes that operation fail. This might be due to a badly formulated request (for example, the <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> field is invalid, and  <i>aio_error</i>() returns <b>[EINVAL]</b>) or might arise from application behavior (for example, the file descriptor is closed before the operation is initiated, and  <i>aio_error</i>() returns <b>[EBADF]</b>).<div class="spacer">
</div>
The limitation on the set of error codes returned when operations from the list shall have been initiated enables applications to know when operations have been started and whether  <i>aio_error</i>() is valid for a specific operation.</div>
