<h1>NAME</h1> aio_fsync &#8212; asynchronous file synchronization</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><br/>
#include &lt;aio.h&gt;<div class="spacer">
</div>
int aio_fsync(int <i>op</i>, struct aiocb *<i>aiocbp</i>);<br/>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The  <i>aio_fsync</i>() function shall asynchronously perform a file synchronization operation, as specified by the <i>op</i> argument, for I/O operations associated with the file indicated by the file descriptor <i>aio_fildes</i> member of the <b>aiocb</b> structure referenced by the <i>aiocbp</i> argument and queued at the time of the call to  <i>aio_fsync</i>(). The function call shall return when the synchronization request has been initiated or queued to the file or device (even when the data cannot be synchronized immediately).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>op</i> is O_DSYNC, all currently queued I/O operations shall be completed as if by a call to  <i>fdatasync</i>(); that is, as defined for synchronized I/O data integrity completion.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>op</i> is O_SYNC, all currently queued I/O operations shall be completed as if by a call to  <i>fsync</i>(); that is, as defined for synchronized I/O file integrity completion. If the  <i>aio_fsync</i>() function fails, or if the operation queued by  <i>aio_fsync</i>() fails, then outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have been completed.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If  <i>aio_fsync</i>() succeeds, then it is only the I/O that was queued at the time of the call to  <i>aio_fsync</i>() that is guaranteed to be forced to the relevant completion state. The completion of subsequent I/O on the file descriptor is not guaranteed to be completed in a synchronized fashion.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>aiocbp</i> argument refers to an asynchronous I/O control block. The <i>aiocbp</i> value may be used as an argument to  <i>aio_error</i>() and  <i>aio_return</i>() in order to determine the error status and return status, respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is proceeding. When the request is queued, the error status for the operation is <b>[EINPROGRESS]</b>. When all data has been successfully transferred, the error status shall be reset to reflect the success or failure of the operation. If the operation does not complete successfully, the error status for the operation shall be set to indicate the error. The <i>aio_sigevent</i> member determines the asynchronous notification to occur as specified in <i>Section 2.4.1</i>, <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i> when all operations have achieved synchronized I/O completion. All other members of the structure referenced by <i>aiocbp</i> are ignored. If the control block referenced by <i>aiocbp</i> becomes an illegal address prior to asynchronous I/O completion, then the behavior is undefined.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the  <i>aio_fsync</i>() function fails or <i>aiocbp</i> indicates an error condition, data is not guaranteed to have been successfully transferred.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>RETURN VALUE</h1> The  <i>aio_fsync</i>() function shall return the value 0 if the I/O operation is successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall return the value &#8722;1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>ERRORS</h1> The  <i>aio_fsync</i>() function shall fail if:<dl>
<dt>
<b>EAGAIN</b></dt>
<dd>
The requested asynchronous operation was not queued due to temporary resource limitations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EBADF</b></dt>
<dd>
The <i>aio_fildes</i> member of the <b>aiocb</b> structure referenced by the <i>aiocbp</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
This implementation does not support synchronized I/O for this file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
The <i>aio_fildes</i> member of the <b>aiocb</b> structure refers to a file on which an  <i>fsync</i>() operation is not possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>EINVAL</b></dt>
<dd>
A value of <i>op</i> other than O_DSYNC or O_SYNC was specified, or O_DSYNC was specified and the implementation does not provide runtime support for the Synchronized Input and Output option, or O_SYNC was specified and the implementation does not provide runtime support for the File Synchronization option.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail,  <i>aio_fsync</i>() shall return the error condition defined for  <i>read</i>() and  <i>write</i>(). The error is returned in the error status for the asynchronous operation, which can be retrieved using  <i>aio_error</i>().<div class="spacer">
