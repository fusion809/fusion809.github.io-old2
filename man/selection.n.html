<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> This command provides a Tcl interface to the X selection mechanism and implements the full selection functionality described in the X Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM).<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that for management of the CLIPBOARD selection (see below), the  <b>clipboard</b> command may also be used.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The first argument to <b>selection</b> determines the format of the rest of the arguments and the behavior of the command.  The following forms are currently supported:<dl>
<dt>
<b>selection clear</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <i>window</i>? ?<b>-selection</b> <i>selection</i>?</dt>
<dd>
If <i>selection</i> exists anywhere on <i>window</i>'s display, clear it so that no window owns the selection anymore.   <i>Selection</i> specifies the X selection that should be cleared, and should be an atom name such as PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD; see the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual for complete details.  <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY and <i>window</i> defaults to &#8220;.&#8221;. Returns an empty string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>selection get</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <i>window</i>? ?<b>-selection</b> <i>selection</i>? ?<b>-type</b> <i>type</i>?</dt>
<dd>
Retrieves the value of <i>selection</i> from <i>window</i>'s display and returns it as a result.   <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY and  <i>window</i> defaults to &#8220;.&#8221;.  <i>Type</i> specifies the form in which the selection is to be returned (the desired &#8220;target&#8221; for conversion, in ICCCM terminology), and should be an atom name such as STRING or FILE_NAME; see the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual for complete details.  <i>Type</i> defaults to STRING.  The selection owner may choose to return the selection in any of several different representation formats, such as STRING, UTF8_STRING, ATOM, INTEGER, etc. (this format is different than the selection type; see the ICCCM for all the confusing details). If the selection is returned in a non-string format, such as INTEGER or ATOM, the  <b>selection</b> command converts it to string format as a collection of fields separated by spaces: atoms are converted to their textual names, and anything else is converted to hexadecimal integers. Note that  <b>selection get</b> does not retrieve the selection in the UTF8_STRING format unless told to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>selection handle</b> ?<b>-selection</b> <i>s</i>? ?<b>-type</b> <i>t</i>? ?<b>-format</b> <i>f</i>? <i>window command</i></dt>
<dd>
Creates a handler for selection requests, such that <i>command</i> will be executed whenever selection  <i>s</i> is owned by <i>window</i> and someone attempts to retrieve it in the form given by type  <i>t</i> (e.g.  <i>t</i> is specified in the <b>selection get</b> command).  <i>S</i> defaults to PRIMARY, <i>t</i> defaults to STRING, and  <i>f</i> defaults to STRING.  If <i>command</i> is an empty string then any existing handler for  <i>window</i>, <i>t</i>, and  <i>s</i> is removed. Note that when the selection is handled as type STRING it is also automatically handled as type UTF8_STRING as well.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
When <i>selection</i> is requested, <i>window</i> is the selection owner, and  <i>type</i> is the requested type, <i>command</i> will be executed as a Tcl command with two additional numbers appended to it (with space separators). The two additional numbers are  <i>offset</i> and <i>maxChars</i>:  <i>offset</i> specifies a starting character position in the selection and  <i>maxChars</i> gives the maximum number of characters to retrieve.  The command should return a value consisting of at most  <i>maxChars</i> of the selection, starting at position  <i>offset</i>.  For very large selections (larger than <i>maxChars</i>) the selection will be retrieved using several invocations of  <i>command</i> with increasing  <i>offset</i> values.  If <i>command</i> returns a string whose length is less than  <i>maxChars</i>, the return value is assumed to include all of the remainder of the selection;  if the length of  <i>command</i>'s result is equal to <i>maxChars</i> then  <i>command</i> will be invoked again, until it eventually returns a result shorter than  <i>maxChars</i>.  The value of <i>maxChars</i> will always be relatively large (thousands of characters).<div class="spacer">
</div>
If <i>command</i> returns an error then the selection retrieval is rejected just as if the selection did not exist at all.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>format</i> argument specifies the representation that should be used to transmit the selection to the requester (the second column of Table 2 of the ICCCM), and defaults to STRING.  If  <i>format</i> is STRING, the selection is transmitted as 8-bit ASCII characters (i.e. just in the form returned by  <i>command</i>, in the system <b>encoding</b>; the UTF8_STRING format always uses UTF-8 as its encoding). If  <i>format</i> is ATOM, then the return value from  <i>command</i> is divided into fields separated by white space;  each field is converted to its atom value, and the 32-bit atom value is transmitted instead of the atom name. For any other  <i>format</i>, the return value from <i>command</i> is divided into fields separated by white space and each field is converted to a 32-bit integer;  an array of integers is transmitted to the selection requester.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>format</i> argument is needed only for compatibility with selection requesters that do not use Tk.  If Tk is being used to retrieve the selection then the value is converted back to a string at the requesting end, so  <i>format</i> is irrelevant.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>selection own</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <i>window</i>? ?<b>-selection</b> <i>selection</i>?</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>selection own</b> ?<b>-command</b> <i>command</i>? ?<b>-selection</b> <i>selection</i>? <i>window</i></dt>
<dd>
The first form of <b>selection own</b> returns the path name of the window in this application that owns  <i>selection</i> on the display containing  <i>window</i>, or an empty string if no window in this application owns the selection.   <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY and  <i>window</i> defaults to &#8220;.&#8221;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The second form of <b>selection own</b> causes <i>window</i> to become the new owner of  <i>selection</i> on <i>window</i>'s display, returning an empty string as result. The existing owner, if any, is notified that it has lost the selection. If  <i>command</i> is specified, it is a Tcl script to execute when some other window claims ownership of the selection away from  <i>window</i>.  <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY.</div>

<h1>EXAMPLES</h1> On X11 platforms, one of the standard selections available is the SECONDARY selection. Hardly anything uses it, but here is how to read it using Tk:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
set selContents [<b>selection get</b> -selection SECONDARY]<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
Many different types of data may be available for a selection; the special type TARGETS allows you to get a list of available types:<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
foreach type [<b>selection get</b> -type TARGETS] {<br/>
   puts &quot;Selection PRIMARY supports type $type&quot;<br/>
}<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
To claim the selection, you must first set up a handler to supply the data for the selection.  Then you have to claim the selection...<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
# Set up the data handler ready for incoming requests<br/>
set foo &quot;This is a string with some data in it... blah blah&quot;<br/>
<b>selection handle</b> -selection SECONDARY . getData<br/>
proc getData {offset maxChars} {<br/>
   puts &quot;Retrieving selection starting at $offset&quot;<br/>
   return [string range $::foo $offset [expr {$offset+$maxChars}]]<br/>
}<div class="spacer">
</div>
<br/>
# Now we grab the selection itself<br/>
puts &quot;Claiming selection&quot;<br/>
<b>selection own</b> -command lost -selection SECONDARY .<br/>
proc lost {} {<br/>
   puts &quot;Lost selection&quot;<br/>
}<br/>
