<h1>NAME</h1> refchan - Command handler API of reflected channels, version 1</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>  <b>cmdPrefix </b><i>option</i> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 0.00em;">
&#160;</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> The Tcl-level handler for a reflected channel has to be a command with subcommands (termed an  <i>ensemble</i>, as it is a command such as that created by  <b>namespace ensemble create</b>, though the implementation of handlers for reflected channel  <i>is not</i> tied to <b>namespace</b>  <b>ensemble</b>s in any way). Note that <i>cmdPrefix</i> is whatever was specified in the call to  <b>chan create</b>, and may consist of multiple arguments; this will be expanded to multiple words in place of the prefix.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Of all the possible subcommands, the handler <i>must</i> support  <b>initialize</b>, <b>finalize</b>, and <b>watch</b>. Support for the other subcommands is optional.<div class="subsection">
<h2>MANDATORY SUBCOMMANDS</h2><dl>
<dt>
<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>initialize </b><i>channelId mode</i></dt>
<dd>
An invocation of this subcommand will be the first call the  <i>cmdPrefix</i> will receive for the specified new <i>channelId</i>. It is the responsibility of this subcommand to set up any internal data structures required to keep track of the channel and its state.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return value of the method has to be a list containing the names of all subcommands supported by the  <i>cmdPrefix</i>. This also tells the Tcl core which version of the API for reflected channels is used by this command handler.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Any error thrown by the method will abort the creation of the channel and no channel will be created. The thrown error will appear as error thrown by  <b>chan create</b>. Any exception other than an <b>error</b> (e.g.  <b>break</b>, etc.) is treated as (and converted to) an error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Note:</b> If the creation of the channel was aborted due to failures here, then the  <b>finalize</b> subcommand will not be called.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>mode</i> argument tells the handler whether the channel was opened for reading, writing, or both. It is a list containing any of the strings  <b>read</b> or <b>write</b>. The list will always contain at least one element.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The subcommand must throw an error if the chosen mode is not supported by the  <i>cmdPrefix</i>.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>finalize </b><i>channelId</i></dt>
<dd>
An invocation of this subcommand will be the last call the  <i>cmdPrefix</i> will receive for the specified <i>channelId</i>. It will be generated just before the destruction of the data structures of the channel held by the Tcl core. The command handler  <i>must not</i> access the  <i>channelId</i> anymore in no way. Upon this subcommand being called, any internal resources allocated to this channel must be cleaned up.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return value of this subcommand is ignored.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the subcommand throws an error the command which caused its invocation (usually  <b>close</b>) will appear to have thrown this error. Any exception beyond  <i>error</i> (e.g. <i>break</i>, etc.) is treated as (and converted to) an error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This subcommand is not invoked if the creation of the channel was aborted during  <b>initialize</b> (See above).</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>watch </b><i>channelId eventspec</i></dt>
<dd>
This subcommand notifies the <i>cmdPrefix</i> that the specified  <i>channelId</i> is interested in the events listed in the  <i>eventspec</i>. This argument is a list containing any of <b>read</b> and  <b>write</b>. The list may be empty, which signals that the channel does not wish to be notified of any events. In that situation, the handler should disable event generation completely.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
<b>Warning:</b> Any return value of the subcommand is ignored. This includes all errors thrown by the subcommand, break, continue, and custom return codes.<div class="spacer">
</div>
This subcommand interacts with <b>chan postevent</b>. Trying to post an event which was not listed in the last call to  <b>watch</b> will cause  <b>chan postevent</b> to throw an error.</div>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h2>OPTIONAL SUBCOMMANDS</h2><dl>
<dt>
<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>read </b><i>channelId count</i></dt>
<dd>
This <i>optional</i> subcommand is called when the user requests data from the channel  <i>channelId</i>. <i>count</i> specifies how many <b>bytes</b> have been requested. If the subcommand is not supported then it is not possible to read from the channel handled by the command.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return value of this subcommand is taken as the requested data  <i>bytes</i>. If the returned data contains more bytes than requested, an error will be signaled and later thrown by the command which performed the read (usually  <b>gets</b> or <b>read</b>). However, returning fewer bytes than requested is acceptable.<div class="spacer">
</div>
Note that returning nothing (0 bytes) is a signal to the higher layers that  <b>EOF</b> has been reached on the channel. To signal that the channel is out of data right now, but has not yet reached  <b>EOF</b>, it is necessary to throw the error &quot;EAGAIN&quot;, i.e. to either<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
return -code error EAGAIN<br/>
</div>
or<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
error EAGAIN<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For extensibility any error whose value is a negative integer number will cause the higher layers to set the C-level variable &quot; <b>errno</b>&quot; to the absolute value of this number, signaling a system error. This means that both<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
return -code error -11<br/>
</div>
and<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
error -11<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
are equivalent to the examples above, using the more readable string &quot;EAGAIN&quot;. No other error value has such a mapping to a symbolic string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the subcommand throws any other error, the command which caused its invocation (usually  <b>gets</b>, or <b>read</b>) will appear to have thrown this error. Any exception beyond  <i>error</i>, (e.g.  <i>break</i>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an error.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>write </b><i>channelId data</i></dt>
<dd>
This <i>optional</i> subcommand is called when the user writes data to the channel  <i>channelId</i>. The <i>data</i> argument contains <i>bytes</i>, not characters. Any type of transformation (EOL, encoding) configured for the channel has already been applied at this point. If this subcommand is not supported then it is not possible to write to the channel handled by the command.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return value of the subcommand is taken as the number of bytes written by the channel. Anything non-numeric will cause an error to be signaled and later thrown by the command which performed the write. A negative value implies that the write failed. Returning a value greater than the number of bytes given to the handler, or zero, is forbidden and will cause the Tcl core to throw an error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
To signal that the channel is not able to accept data for writing right now, it is necessary to throw the error &quot;EAGAIN&quot;, i.e. to either<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
return -code error EAGAIN<br/>
</div>
or<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
error EAGAIN<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
For extensibility any error whose value is a negative integer number will cause the higher layers to set the C-level variable &quot; <b>errno</b>&quot; to the absolute value of this number, signaling a system error. However, note that the exact mapping between these error numbers and their meanings is operating system dependent.<div class="spacer">
</div>
For example, while on Linux both<div class="spacer">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
return -code error -11<br/>
</div>
and<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
error -11<br/>
</div>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
are equivalent to the examples above, using the more readable string &quot;EAGAIN&quot;, this is not true for BSD, where the equivalent number is -35.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The symbolic string however is the same across systems, and internally translated to the correct number. No other error value has such a mapping to a symbolic string.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the subcommand throws any other error the command which caused its invocation (usually  <b>puts</b>) will appear to have thrown this error. Any exception beyond  <i>error</i> (e.g.&#160;<i>break</i>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an error.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>seek </b><i>channelId offset base</i></dt>
<dd>
This <i>optional</i> subcommand is responsible for the handling of  <b>seek</b> and <b>tell</b> requests on the channel <i>channelId</i>. If it is not supported then seeking will not be possible for the channel.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>base</i> argument is one of<dl>
<dt>
<b>start</b></dt>
<dd>
Seeking is relative to the beginning of the channel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>current</b></dt>
<dd>
Seeking is relative to the current seek position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>end</b></dt>
<dd>
Seeking is relative to the end of the channel.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>base</i> argument of the builtin <b>chan seek</b> command takes the same names.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The <i>offset</i> is an integer number specifying the amount of  <b>bytes</b> to seek forward or backward. A positive number should seek forward, and a negative number should seek backward.<div class="spacer">
</div>
A channel may provide only limited seeking. For example sockets can seek forward, but not backward.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return value of the subcommand is taken as the (new) location of the channel, counted from the start. This has to be an integer number greater than or equal to zero.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the subcommand throws an error the command which caused its invocation (usually  <b>seek</b>, or <b>tell</b>) will appear to have thrown this error. Any exception beyond  <i>error</i> (e.g. <i>break</i>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an error.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The offset/base combination of 0/<b>current</b> signals a <b>tell</b> request, i.e. seek nothing relative to the current location, making the new location identical to the current one, which is then returned.</div>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>configure </b><i>channelId option value</i></dt>
<dd>
This <i>optional</i> subcommand is for setting the type-specific options of channel  <i>channelId</i>. The <i>option</i> argument indicates the option to be written, and the  <i>value</i> argument indicates the value to set the option to.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="spacer">
</div>
This subcommand will never try to update more than one option at a time; that is behavior implemented in the Tcl channel core.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The return value of the subcommand is ignored.<div class="spacer">
</div>
If the subcommand throws an error the command which performed the (re)configuration or query (usually  <b>fconfigure</b> or <b>chan</b>  <b>configure</b>) will appear to have thrown this error. Any exception beyond  <i>error</i> (e.g. <i>break</i>, etc.) is treated as and converted to an error.</div>
<dl>

<i>cmdPrefix </i><b>cget </b><i>channelId option</i></dt>

<h1>NOTES</h1> Some of the functions supported in channels defined in Tcl's C interface are not available to channels reflected to the Tcl level.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function <b>Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc</b> is not supported; i.e. reflected channels do not have OS specific handles.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function <b>Tcl_DriverHandlerProc</b> is not supported. This driver function is relevant only for stacked channels, i.e. transformations. Reflected channels are always base channels, not transformations.<div class="spacer">
</div>
The function <b>Tcl_DriverFlushProc</b> is not supported. This is because the current generic I/O layer of Tcl does not use this function anywhere at all. Therefore support at the Tcl level makes no sense either. This may be altered in the future (through extending the API defined here and changing its version number) should the function be used at some time in the future.</div>
