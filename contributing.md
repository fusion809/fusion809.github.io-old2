**The Hornery**, as its name suggests (which, if you have not figured out is a play on my surname, Horne) is really just my (fusion809/Brenton)'s personal website. So its format is not really that of a Wiki (wherein everyone is invited to join in and contribute), despite this, if you find something that you feel is inaccurate or misinformed, I am interested in receiving your feedback. Please remember, however, that if your feedback is more subjective than it is objective (in other you are telling me what you *think* or *believe* and not what you *know* and have evidence to support), odds are it will ignored, as this website is supposed to be from *my point of view*. I will also accept any recommendations of how to improve this website, in its aesthetics and such. There are four main ways you can provide me with feedback:
* Comment on social media where I have shared the post in question.
* Send an email to me at [brentonhorne77@gmail.com](mailto:brentonhorne77@gmail.com).
* [Start an issue](https://github.com/fusion809/fusion809.github.io/issues/new) at this website's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fusion809/fusion809.github.io).
* [Start a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) at this website's GitHub repository, that includes the changes you are recommending.

You can use any of these four methods &mdash; I, for my part, have no particular preference, so long as you are clear in how you describe the issue.
