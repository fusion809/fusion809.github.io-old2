### Basic Definitions

#### Command-Line Interface
A [**command-line interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (**CLI**) or **command-line interpreter** is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with their computer by issuing a series of commands. On &#42;nix systems the most common type of CLI are [Unix shells](#unix-shells).

#### Fork
In the field of software development a [**fork**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) is when software developers take a copy of a project's source code and start working on it independently of its previous developers. Proprietary software licenses do not usually allow for forks except with the expressed permission of the software's previous developer(s). In the FOSS community forks are common due to the fact that FOSS licenses permit the creation of forks without the previous developer(s)'s permission.

#### Graphical User Interface
A [**graphical user interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (**GUI**) is a type of interface that allows users to interact with their computer using graphical icons and visual indicators. This is as opposed to command-line interfaces (CLIs) and textual user interfaces (TUIs), in which users interact with the computer by issuing lines of commands or by writing textual responses to prompts. The most notable type of GUI found on many &#42;nix systems is that of a desktop environment like Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, LXDE, MATE, Xfce, *etc.*

#### Hardware
[**Computer hardware**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) consists of the physical or tangible components of a computer, including its [**hard disk drive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) (**HDD**, or simply **hard drive**), [**central processing unit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) (**CPU**), [**graphics card**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card), *etc.*

#### Integrated Development Environment
An {% include Links/wpb.md name="Integrated Development Environment" %} (**IDE**) is a program that provides users, supposedly comprehensive, facilities for software development. I used the word "*supposedly*", to draw attention to the fact that the definition of comprehensive does vary quite substantially from IDE to IDE.

#### Software
[**Software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) are the non-physical or tangible components of a computer, specifically data stored on a computer's hard drive, computer programs (e.g., the web browser you are using to view this blog post), software libraries, *etc.*
