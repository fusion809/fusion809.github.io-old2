### Licensing Definitions

#### Copyleft License
[**Copyleft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), which is a play on the word &ldquo;copyright&rdquo;, in the context of software licensing, refers to licenses that allow people to freely distribute copies of software licensed under their terms, as well as to make any modifications of the software they see fit and redistribute these modified versions provided they distribute these modified versions under a similar copyleft license. One of the most popular examples of a copyleft license is the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) (GPL).

#### Free and Open-Source Software
[**Free and open-source software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (**FOSS**) refers to software that is **freely licensed** to be used, studied, copied, modified in anyway, and is **open-source** so that anyone with the skill and inclination is free to improve on the software should they choose, provided they conform to the requirements of its respective license. FOSS is licensed under either a copyleft or permissive license or licenses in between (e.g., the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) and [Mozilla Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License)).

#### Freeware
[**Freeware**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware), refers to software that is licensed under a proprietary license (hence meaning it is **not** open-source), but available free of charge. Notable examples include Google Chrome and Spotify, as while they are free, you are not free to access, modify and redistribute their source code.

#### Open-Source Software
[**Open-source software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (**OSS**) refers to any piece of software that's source code is freely shared and licensed, so that anyone with the inclination and/or the skill can look at, modify, redistribute, *etc.* the source code without fear of being justly called or even charged as a pirate, provided they abide by the terms of the source code's license.

#### Permissive License
[**Permissive licenses**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_license) are FOSS licenses that do not require that derivatives of the software licensed under their terms be released under similar FOSS licenses. Popular examples of permissive licenses include the various BSD licenses and the MIT License.
