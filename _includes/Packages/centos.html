<abbr title="Unfortunately CentOS has no website where one can see whether a given package is in their official repositories. So I have fired up my CentOS 7 VM to check for the package and looked at the EPEL repositories for CentOS 6 and 7 in order to determine whether the package is in CentOS's official repositories. The result is yes, this package is in the CentOS official repositories.">CentOS</abbr>
