**The Hornery** is a website where I, Brenton (aka fusion809), store my ramblings about what I am up to with regard to my journey through the world of free and open-source and Linux, in particular. I also store HOWTOs, guides, comparisons and other types of articles based on my own experience that is designed to be helpful to readers. If you have any corrections to this site I suggest you see [contributing](/contributing/).
