### Package Management System
A **package management system** (**PMS**, plural form: **PMSs**) or **package manager** is a collection of system software that automates the process of installing, configuring, removing and upgrading software packages. Traditionally Linux PMSs were operated solely from the command-line but nowadays several graphical PMSs also exist.
