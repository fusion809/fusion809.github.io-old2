### Governance
In the context of open-source projects, the term **governance** refers to how the project is governed or lead. Some projects are **authoritarian** in governance, in other words they are dictatorships, with a single leader in charge. A notable example of such a project is the Slackware Linux Project. Others are **donation-sponsored democracies**, wherein the volunteer developers of the project usually have the power to make decisions via consensus. Likewise others are **company-sponsored semi-democracies**, wherein a company sponsors the project and has some say over decisions, but the majority of the authority to make decisions about the project resides with the community of volunteer developers (or so it should, whether it does in practise is something I will likely not know until I work in one).
