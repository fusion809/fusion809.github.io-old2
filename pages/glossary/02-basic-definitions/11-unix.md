### Unix
**Unix** (or **UNIX** for the trademark) is a family of operating systems that share several common characteristics and are certified as being compliant to at least one version of the **Single UNIX Specification** (**SUS**). These common characteristics are best summarized with what is sometimes called the "**Unix philosophy**". The Unix philosophy is that the operating system provides a set of simple command-line tools or utilities (which I will sometimes refer to as Unix utilities) that perform a limited, well-defined function, which usually involves manipulating components (like files) in the unified file system that is also characteristic of Unix systems. Additionally Unix systems also have what is known as a command language or shell scripting language, called a **Unix shell**, with which users can call on these simple tools. Unix is also notable in that it is designed to be easily portable to a variety of different computers (distinguished from one another, mostly by the details of their CPU).
