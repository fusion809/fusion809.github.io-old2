### Hardware
A computer's **hardware** comprises the physical components of the computer, like its **hard drive** (or **hard disk drive** [**HDD**]) on which information is stored (analogous to a person's long-term memory), **random-access memory** (**RAM**) devices (analogous to someone's working memory) and **central processing unit** (**CPU**) or processor (which is where information processing is done, this processing is analogous to a person's thoughts). The term "computer architecture" or "**instruction set architecture**" (**ISA**) refers to the set of instructions that the CPU, in question, can understand.
