### Source Code
**Source code** is a collection of computer instructions written in at least one human-readable computer language. The type of computer language most frequently-used to write computer programs are so called &ldquo;programming languages&rdquo; such as C, C++, Python, *etc.* Other common computer languages sometimes used to write computer programs (usually alongside programming languages) include markup languages (like HTML and Markdown) and style sheet languages (like CSS). For example, the Atom text editor is written in CoffeeScript, HTML, JavaScript and CSS, where CoffeeScript and JavaScript are programming languages.
