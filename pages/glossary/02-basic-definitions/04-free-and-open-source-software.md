### Free and Open-Source Software
**Free and open-source software** (**FOSS**) refers to software who's source code is licensed such that it can freely shared, distributed, studied and even modified and re-released by anyone. FOSS licenses usually require that anyone that modifies and re-releases the source code gives some recognition to the original authors of the source code and some licenses (which are called **copyleft** licenses) even require that the modified source code be released under a similar (if not identical) license to the original source code. The most popular copyleft license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), while the most popular non-copyleft (or **permissive**) FOSS licenses include the BSD licenses and the MIT License.
