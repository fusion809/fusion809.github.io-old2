### Operating System
An **operating system** (**OS**) is the base set of system software that forms the foundation for other programs to run on top of. It manages all communication between the computer's hardware and the application software that run on top of it.

* FreeBSD

* MS-DOS
* OS X
* Windows 1.0 to Windows ME (including Windows 95 and 98)
