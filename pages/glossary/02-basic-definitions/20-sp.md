### Software Package
**Software packages** are distributions (or *packages*) of software and data contained within a file archive. This archive is sometimes compressed so as to save space and make them easier to transfer over a network. Software packages usually also contain some metadata, that is, information about the contents of the package. Example software package formats include:

* Debian package format (file extension: `.deb`) &mdash; used by Debian's dpkg package manager. They are archives created using the Unix `ar` utility.
* pacman package format (file extension: `.pkg.tar.xz`) &mdash; used by Arch Linux and other Linux distributions using the pacman package manager. They are xz-compressed tar archives. 
* RPM package format (file extension: `.rpm`) &mdash; used by Red Hat's RPM package manager.
