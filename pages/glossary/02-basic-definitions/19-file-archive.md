### File Archive
A **file archive** is a type of file, that stores one or more files, potentially with associated metadata, in a more portable and easily-compressed format. On Linux and other &#42;nix systems, the most common type of file archive is a tar archive (which have the `.tar` file extension), with rar archives (file extension: `.rar`) being a popular alternative, especially for non-Linux platforms such as Windows. `tar` is a basic Unix utility, the specifics of this utility, its syntax, supported file formats, *etc.* is dependent on the &#42;nix system it belongs to. Most Linux distributions use GNU tar as their default tar utility, but also have FreeBSD's tar (usually called by the `bsdtar` command) utility available from their software repositories.
