### Software Version Nomenclature
In the field of software development, software releases are usually distinguished from one another by use of a numbering scheme. Each project has a different numbering scheme. The most common scheme is of the form:

* `x.y.z`. `x`, `y` and `z` are all natural numbers (that is, `x`, `y`, `z` <abbr title="Is an element of">&isin;</abbr> `{0, 1, 2, 3, ...}`). `x` is the series of the software. Different series usually have different feature sets and qualities. `y` is the major version of the software. `z` is the bug fix version of the software. If you are sick of my algebra I will give you an example of a program that follows this versioning scheme: the Linux kernel. An example version is the 4.4.6 version.
