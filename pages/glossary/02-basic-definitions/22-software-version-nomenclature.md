### Software Version Nomenclature
In the field of software development, software releases are usually distinguished from one another by use of a numbering scheme. Each project has a different numbering scheme. The most common scheme is of the form:

* `x.y.z`. `x`, `y` and `z` are all natural numbers (that is, `x`, `y`, `z` &isin; {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}). `x` is the series of the software. Different series usually have different feature sets and qualities. `y` is the major version of the software.
