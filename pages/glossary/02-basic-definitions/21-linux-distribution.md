### Linux Distribution
A **Linux distribution** (**LD** or **distro**) is an individual, specific, operating system that uses the Linux kernel (that is, a specific member of the Linux family of operating systems). Most Linux distributions use GNU Project software for their Unix utilities, hence meaning that most Linux distributions can also be called **GNU/Linux distributions**. An LD consists of, at least, the following basic components:

* The **Linux kernel** (or the **Linux-libre kernel**, in some cases)
* **GNU Project software**, such as Bash, the coreutils package, glibc, *etc.*
* A **package management system**, such as APT, DNF, Entropy, pacman, Portage, *etc.*
