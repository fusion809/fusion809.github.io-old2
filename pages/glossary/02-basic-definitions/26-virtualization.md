### Virtualization
**Virtualization** is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something. Most commonly this "something" is an operating system. Virtualization is usually performed using computer programs that can be referred to as virtualization programs. In this context, the **host** is the computer being used to run the virtualization program, while the **guest** is the virtual system being run. For example, I am presently typing this glossary section on Arch Linux, so if I fire up a CentOS 7 VM in Oracle VM VirtualBox, then my host operating system would be Arch Linux and my guest operating system would be CentOS 7.
