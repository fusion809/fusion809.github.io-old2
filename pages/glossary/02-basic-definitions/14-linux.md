### Linux
**Linux** is a large family of Unix-like operating systems (its members are referred to, collectively, as Linux distributions) that share one common defining characteristic: they use the Linux kernel as their kernel. The Linux kernel is a predominantly free and open-source kernel developed by Linus Torvalds who first started developing the kernel in 1991 when he was a 21-year-old computer science student studying at the University of Helsinki in Finland. I used the phrasing "*predominantly* free and open-source" deliberately, as while most of the kernel's source code is licensed under the GNU GPL, there are some binary blobs on the kernel (which mostly just add to its compatibility with available hardware) that are not free and open-source.
