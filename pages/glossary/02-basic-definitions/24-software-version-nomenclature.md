### Software Version Nomenclature
In the field of software development, software releases are usually distinguished from one another by use of a numbering scheme. Each project has a different numbering scheme. The most common scheme is of the form:

* `x.y.z`. `x`, `y` and `z` are all natural numbers (that is, `x`, `y`, `z` &isin; `{0, 1, 2, 3, ...}`). `x` is the major version of the software. Major versions have major feature differences in them, for example, the 4.0 Linux kernel had far more features than the 3.0 version of the Linux kernel. `y` is the minor version of the software. Minor software releases (where the only difference is the minor version number of the software. For example 4.6.0 is one minor release ahead of 4.5.0) usually only differ by a few, often minor features. `z` is the patch (or bug-fix) version of the software. If you are sick of my algebra I will give you an example of a program that follows this versioning scheme: the Linux kernel. An example version of the kernel is the 4.9.6 kernel. 4 is the major version, 9 is the minor version and 6 is the patch version.
