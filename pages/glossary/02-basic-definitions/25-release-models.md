### Release Models: Fixed vs. Rolling
In the context of operating system development, there are two main types of **release model**: fixed and rolling. The most popular of these is the fixed release model, with the rolling release model being mostly used by bleeding edge operating systems geared towards advanced users like Arch Linux and Gentoo Linux.

Operating systems that follow a **fixed release model**[^1] (**FRM**) have fixed releases,[^2] which users are required to upgrade to, in order to keep their system up-to-date. This upgrade process can be (1) via downloading or otherwise acquiring the installation media[^3] for the latest version and going through its installer,[^4] or (2) via the distribution's package manager[^5] or other methods (e.g., Ubuntu uses the `do-release-upgrade` command). These upgrades usually include major updates for several pieces of software, including core system components like the kernel, C libraries, compilers, core utilities, *etc.* In my experience, this process takes hours, uses up a lot of bandwidth and usually breaks at least one program on one's system. This is why I, personally, are not a big fan of systems following a FRM.

Systems following a **rolling release model** (**RRM**) have no fixed releases, rather software updates, including major ones, simply become available for installation as soon as they have been packaged by the repository's maintainers.
