[**AppImages**](http://appimage.org/) are a type of *cross-distribution packaging format* (CDPF), that are not installed and need no special tools to be run. They contain all the libraries, binaries, desktop configuration files and icons that the application provided by the AppImage requires. AppImages are compressed using xorriso, a GNU tool used to build ISO files. I have created a few AppImages of mine own, the most successful one so far is my Eclipse C++ one, which I uploaded [here](https://github.com/fusion809/AppImages/releases/tag/Eclipse-4.6.0-1).
