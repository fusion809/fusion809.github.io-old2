### Fedora / openSUSE
They are stored in one of two locations:

* My {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="rpmbuild" %} GitHub repository &mdash; I only store packages here that require an Internet connection during the build. For example, an `atom` and `atom-beta` package. The RPMs contained therein are only designed to compatible with openSUSE, so they may not work on Fedora.
* [My Home OBS Project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:fusion809/). This contains packages that are built for both Fedora and openSUSE.
* [My openSUSE OBS Project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:fusion809:opensuse/). This contains packages that are built for openSUSE only.
