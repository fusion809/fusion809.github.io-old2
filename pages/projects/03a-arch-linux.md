### Arch Linux
The **Arch Linux Packages** (**ALPs**) I develop or maintain are found in three locations, although some packages can be found in more than one of these locations. These locations are:

* [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=fusion809)
* My {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="PKGBUILDs" %} GitHub repository.
* {% include Links/obs.md project="home:fusion809:arch_extra" name="My Arch_Extra OBS Project" %}
