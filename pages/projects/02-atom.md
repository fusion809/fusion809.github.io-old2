## Atom
Atom is my favourite text editor, and as such I have several GitHub repositories related to it, including (those covered in later sections of this page are excluded from this list):

* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="about" %} &mdash; a fork of the official [`about`](https://github.com/atom/about) Atom package, with some customizations to make it more relevant to my custom builds of Atom.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="atom-1" %} &mdash; a fork of the official Atom source code repository, where in the 1.8-releases branch I have edited the package.json to include some custom packages and exclude some core packages I do not want. The reason I went through all this effort to make such trivial adjustments to the source code is because I wanted to build a Snappy package using this source.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="fusion-ui" %} &mdash; a fork of the [`accents-ui`](https://atom.io/packages/accents-ui)
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="language-archlinux" %} &mdash; a package that I based on the `language-gentoo` package of Nicolas Laurent, which analogously to the `language-gentoo` package provides some common commands for package development, only difference is that they are for Arch Linux instead of Gentoo Linux package development.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="language-gfm2" %} &mdash; a fork of the core `language-gfm` package that, when installed along with `language-liquid`, provides additional syntax-highlighting for Liquid and HTML code in your GitHub-flavoured markdown files.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="language-ini-desktop" %} &mdash; a fork of the `language-ini` package with better desktop configuration file support.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="language-patch2" %} &mdash; a fork of the `language-patch` package with better metadata (which is important for custom Atom builds).
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="language-solus" %} &mdash; a package to provide syntax-highlighting for Solus packaging files.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="terminal-fusion" %} &mdash; an Atom package to provide an embedded, Linux-themed terminal for Atom.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="toolbar-fusion" %} &mdash; an Atom package that adds a toolbar to Atom. 

I have also contributed to the following Atom-related repositories (for a full list see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/fusion809)):

* {% include Links/gr.md user="atom" repo="atom" %} &mdash; the official Atom source code repository.
* {% include Links/gr.md user="Murriouz" repo="dark-bint-syntax" %} &mdash; the `dark-bint-syntax` Atom theme.
* {% include Links/gr.md user="DanBrooker" repo="file-icons" %} &mdash; the `file-icons` Atom package.
* {% include Links/gr.md user="atom" repo="language-less" %} &mdash; the `language-less` core Atom package.
* {% include Links/gr.md user="puranjayjain" repo="language-liquid" %} &mdash; the `language-liquid` Atom package.
