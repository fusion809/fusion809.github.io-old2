## Atom
Atom is my favourite text editor, and as such I have several GitHub repositories related to it, including (those covered in later sections of this page are excluded from this list):

* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="about" %} &mdash; a fork of the official `about` Atom package, with some customizations to make it more relevant to my custom builds of Atom.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="atom-1" %} &mdash; a fork of the official Atom source code repository, where in the 1.8-releases branch I have edited the package.json to include some custom packages and exclude some core packages I do not want.
* {% include Links/fusgr.md repo="language-archlinux" %} &mdash; a package that I based on the `language-gentoo` package of Nicolas Laurent, which analogously to the `language-gentoo` package provides some common commands for package development, only difference is that they are for Arch Linux instead of Gentoo Linux package development.
