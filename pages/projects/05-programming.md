## Programming
I would not consider myself proficient in programming but I have been learning and writing scripts in the following languages:

1. [GNU Octave / MATLAB](https://github.com/fusion809/GNU_Octave)
2. [JavaScript](https://github.com/fusion809/JScripts)
3. [Python](https://github.com/fusion809/python-scripts)

Most, if not all, of these scripts are for scientific computing.
